# Should “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” Be Considered a Sequel or a Reboot?
This repository contains a text analysis experiment that I completed during my Fall Semester at Carnegie Mellon University in a course taught by David Brown. This study aims to determine whether the film Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) should be considered a reboot or a sequel within the Star Wars franchise. Analyses of screenplays including both reboots and sequels will be compared with each other as well as the two Star Wars films in question. Using proper tokenization tactics, keyness tables, and collocation networks, Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) can be classified as a sequel in the franchise.
