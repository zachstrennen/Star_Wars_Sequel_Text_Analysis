# Should “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” Be Considered a Sequel or a Reboot?
This repository contains a text analysis experiment that I completed during my Fall Semester at Carnegie Mellon University in a course taught by David Brown. This study aims to determine whether the film Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) should be considered a reboot or a sequel within the Star Wars franchise. Analyses of screenplays including both reboots and sequels will be compared with each other as well as the two Star Wars films in question. Using proper tokenization tactics, keyness tables, and collocation networks, Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) can be classified as a sequel in the franchise.

# The Data
Six Screenplays were formed as a corpus to be analyzed in this study. The first two obviously being the screenplays for Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) and Star Wars: A New Hope (1977). To analyze the relationships between sequels, the screenplays for the films Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) will be used. Both films take place in the same canonical story-line in the Indiana Jones franchise. While Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) is a sequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), it is not an adjacent sequel. Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) is the first film in the timeline and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) is the fourth film in the timeline. The choice of these films is on purpose as the two Star Wars films also have two films in between them in their timeline. The last two films are reboots of the same title; Dune (1984) and Dune (2021). Each film follows the same protagonists and casts of characters. Additionally, each film follows the same overarching story-line. These films were chosen because the biggest complaint about The Force Awakens is that it follows the same story-line as A New Hope.
