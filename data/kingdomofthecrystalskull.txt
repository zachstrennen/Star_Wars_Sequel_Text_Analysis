		1  EXT DESERT DAY * The Paramount logo dissolves into a mountain in the desert. But  the mountain moves, it starts to crumble, and then --  -- a prairie dog pokes its head out of the mountaintop. In the distance, a CAR ENGINE whines, mid-50s rock ‘n roll BLARES, it gets louder, fast, and the prairie dog bolts for its life.  A car tire FLATTENS the pile as a 1932 Chevy Roadster BLASTS past us, TWO TEENAGE BOYS and TWO PONY-TAILED GIRLS inside. The kids LAUGH and the music cranks as they barrel down the road, don’t care where they’re going, just want to get there fast. *  Up ahead, there are four military vehicles, a ‘51 Ford staff car, two jeeps, and a large panel truck. There are THREE U.S. SOLDIERS in the lead car, TWO MORE in each of the jeeps, and a DRIVER for the truck.  The hot rod pulls up close behind the convoy, then swerves into the passing lane and guns it, passing the truck and jeeps and pulling up even with the lead car.  The DRIVER of the lead car hits the gas too, not about to let these punks pass him -- drag race!  The cars drive flat out, nobody backing off. But then the ARMY COLONEL in the passenger seat of the lead car puts a hand on the Driver’s arm and gestures to a road up ahead -- we go that way.  The military vehicles veer to the right, off the main road, and the Guys and Girls in the Chevy WHOOP in triumph as they barrel away down the road in a cloud of dust, the winners in this race.  But we follow the Army convoy, rising up behind them to get a look at where they’re headed -- toward a remote military outpost in the distance. Very mysterious. A legend:  NEVADA, 1957 
		2  EXT MILITARY OUTPOST DAY  The convoy pulls up to twin guard shacks at the main entrance to the base, which must lie over the rise ahead of us. The gate is identified only by a plain sign hung on the barbed wire:  HANGAR 51  THREE MPS step forward; the SERGEANT signals the cars to stop. * 
2. The Sergeant walks up to the Sedan and leans in. *
M.P. (SERGEANT) * Sorry, gentlemen, this whole area’s off
limits for weapons testing for the next twenty-four hours, that includes all on- base personnel.
The Colonel steps out of the front passenger seat of the third * car. He’s huge, must go two-sixty, all muscle. He’s either * perpetually sneering or has a lipless smile, hard to tell which. A real son-of-a-bitch, good thing he’s on our side.
The MPs snap to attention. The Sergeant salutes the Colonel, but remains firm. The Colonel walks up to the Sergeant. *
M.P. (SERGEANT) (cont’d) I’m afraid that goes for you too,
Colonel, sir. The Pentagon sent out * revised deployment oh-dark-thirty this a.m.
The Colonel smiles, but doesn’t speak. *
The Colonel gets down on one knee. *
-- THE SOLDIERS leap out of the panel truck, silencers screwed * onto the ends of their automatic weapons, and before we know it they’re BLASTING away at the outmanned and outgunned MPs, dropping them before they get their safeties off.
The Colonel finishes tying his shoe, gets up , puts his hat back * on and goes back to the car. *
The soldiers stash the dead bodies in the guard shack. *
The convoy drives past the checkpoint. *
SOLDIERS jump from the back of the truck. The invaders snap into * action, silently, they’ve trained for this. Two of them slip the helmets and armbands off the MPs and put them on themselves. *
A CROWBAR SNAPS the lock off the gate and the fence is thrown open. With the fake MPs now standing guard at the gate, the convoy roars through and we rise up to see --
-- beyond the rise, where there’s a huge airplane hangar and a smaller, adjoining building. A lone airstrip leads right up to the hangar and a set of train tracks run out of the other building and away across the desert.
3.
3 EXT HANGAR 51 DAY
The convoy CRUNCHES to a stop in front of the giant main doors of the hangar. While two INVADING SOLDIERS set about hot-wiring the circuit box that leads to the door mechanism, the Colonel nods to two Soldiers from the truck, *
and they go to the trunk of the sedan. They pop it open, reach inside --
-- and pull out a prisoner, GEORGE MCHALE (”Mac” to his friends), fiftyish, sharp eyes and the easy smile of your favorite bartender. He’s had the hell beaten out of him.
The Russian Soldiers reach into the trunk . The soldier grabs a * fedora hat and throws it to the ground. Both soldiers haul * another bag of bones out, SLAMMING him down on his feet next to Mac. *
Indy gets up, grabs his hat off the floor and puts it on. * One of the soldiers, #2 gets out of the sedan and starts to give *
orders in RUSSIAN- *
RUSSIAN 2 * Gde INZENER. OTKPIT VOROTA. BISTRO! * BISTRO1 BISTRO! (Where’s the engineer? * Open the gates fast) *
Another soldier approaches. *
RUSSIAN 3 * Za mnoy reebiata! BISTRO! Bistro! (Come * guys, come with me faster, * faster) DAVAYTE REEBIATA (C’MON GUYS” * BWISTREY, BWISTREY, BWISTREY! (Let’s go, * let’s go, let’s go) K KAROBKYE (GET TO * THE CIRCUIT BOX!) *
He moves to the hangar door. *
Russians.
INDY * *
3A. Mac squints, sizes up the heavily-armed Russians. He MUTTERS to *
Indy, with a British accent. * MAC *
This ain’t gonna be easy. * A soldier pushes Mac next to Indy. *
INDY * Not as easy as it used to be. *
MAC * We’ve been through worse. *
INDY * Oh yeah? When? *
MAC * Flensburg. There were twice as many. *
INDY * We were younger. *
MAC * I still am young. *
Indy manages a smile--he likes this guy. He looks sideways, at * one of the Russian soldiers, who has a bettered bullwhip hanging * over the shoulder. Indy’s whip. *
INDY * (back to Mac) We had guns. *
MAC * Details. *
INDY * Put your hands down will ya. You’re * embarrassing yourself. *
MAC * I bet you five hundred bucks we get out * of this. *
* * *
4. The Russian Colonel (ANTONIN DOVCHENKO) sedan drives up and comes *
to a stop. Dovchenko steps up to them, nose to nose. He’s huge. *
MAC * Maybe we should make that a * hundred.(make that a hundred) (why don’t * we make that a hundred, alright) *
DOVCHENKO * (to Indy) * You recognize building, yes? *
Indy looks back at the building. Then turns back to Dovchenko. * INDY *
Drop dead. * CRACK! Dovchenko SMACKS INDY across the face and his legs go out
from under him. * INDY (cont’d)
I mean drop dead, Comrade. *
DOVCHENKO * DEPSICUTE EEWY PYKU ZA ENUNON(Hold his * arms behind his back) *
Dovchenko takes off his hat, hands it to one of the soldiers. He * curls his meaty fist to CRACK him across the face again, but a * VOICE stops him.
Prasteete!
VOICE (O.S.)
The back door of the sedan that just arrived a slender figure * steps out, dressed as a U.S. Army soldier. DR. IRINA SPALKO is in
her mid-thirties, tall, pale, jet black hair, bangs cut straight across. She is wearing dark glasses. She moves with a dancer’s grace, a scabbard hanging at her side.
Dovchenko walks up to her, and salutes.
SPALKO Where was he found?
DOVCHENKO In Mexico, they were digging in the dirt.
Looking for this junk.
He gets Indy’s satchel from the trunk of the sedan and turns upside down, empties it on the hard ground. Pieces of ancient pottery and figurines SHATTER.
*
*
*
* *
it * *
5.
Indy winces. That was seven weeks’ work. A Spalko approaches: INDY
You’re not from around here. Are you? *
SPALKO Where is it that you would imagine I am * from, Dr. Jones?
She takes her glasses off. *
INDY The way you sink your teeth into those
Ws, I’d say the Eastern Ukraine.
SPALKO Highest marks.
(she takes off her glove and * holds out her hand)
Colonel Doctor Irina Spalko. (Indy doesn’t shake)
three times I have received Order of Lenin, also medal of Hero of Socialist Labor, and why? Because I know things. I know them before anyone else, and what I do not know, I find out. What I need to know now --
She takes a step closer to Indy and taps a finger lightly on his forehead.
SPALKO -- is in here.
She moves close to him, looks deeply into his eyes. Her gaze is intense, disquieting. He stares back at her. She’s impressed.
SPALKO You are a hard man to read, Dr. Jones.
So we will try this.. What’s the * expression? The old-fashioned way. You * will tell us. You will help us find what we seek.
RUSSIAN SOLDIER * Gatavo tovarisch palkovnik (IT’S READY, * COMRADE COLONEL.) *
Spalko moves towards the doors. She gives the order. *
SPALKO * Davai! (do it!) *
5A.
A SPARK flies from the power box, a big wheel starts to turn, and the huge hangar doors start to RUMBLE open, splitting right between the “5” and the “1.” *
4 INT HANGAR 51 DAY Hangar 51 is a massive warehouse, an endless expanse of crates
stacked to the eighty foot ceilings as far as the eye can see.
This place looks familiar to us, seems like the kind of place a paranoid government would stash its most secret objects.
Indy and Mac are prodded inside, at the end of the Russian gun barrels. Spalko gestures around. *
6.
SPALKO * This warehouse is where you and your
government have hidden all your secrets, * yes? *
INDY I’ve never been here before in my life. *
She smiles at him -- nice try, but I don’t believe your act.
SPALKO Object we seek -- rectangular storage
container. Dimensions -- two meters by one half a meter by 66 centimeters. * Contents of box mummified remains. This * is no doubt familiar to you?
Suddenly Indy knows exactly what she is talking about, but he * hesitates to volunteer anything. *
INDY What makes you think I have any idea what
box you’re talking about?
SPALKO Because ten years ago you were part of * the team that examined it. *
INDY Look even if I knew what you- *
What a sudden SSSSHHHHING!, she draws a rapier and lunges forward in a blindingly quick fencing move, pressing the tip of the blade against Indy’s jugular.
INDY (cont’d) * Were talking about.... *
SPALKO YOU WILL. HELP US. FIND IT!
Indy looks at her coldly.
INDY Killing me’s not gonna solve your * problem. *
SPALKO * “Not gonna solve my problem” You’re * right. *
She BARKS to the Soldiers in Russian . *
6A.
SPALKO (cont’d) * VAZMITYE DRUBOVA!(take the other one) *
7. Two Soldiers drag Mac across the pavement, drop him and kick him *
over in the gravel, right next to a truck. * MAC *
It’s all gone pear shaped. *
Spalko moves forward puts on her glasses. Gives a signal. *
Indy looks on as two soldiers hold him. *
Dovchenko walks over Mac’s body and gets in the truck, he starts * the engine. *
--with a ROAR, drops the truck in gear, hits the gas, and begins * to move slowly towards Mac’s head, as the soldiers hold him down -- *
INDY * Okay, okay! Hey, hey, hey! *
MAC * He said okay for God’s sake. Are you * going to let me up? (4F)Okay , okay, he * said okay- would you let me up? *
7A. INT. HANGAR- DAY *
INDY followed by the whole group, thinks like a wild man, looking * around. There are rectangular storage containers everywhere. *
He walks in and stops, turns to the group. *
INDY * (mind racing)
Alright I need a compass. Compass? * The Soldiers look at each other, confused.
INDY (cont’d) You know, north, south, east?
MAC * West. *
INDY * No? *
They don’t seem to. Indy’s eyes fall on Dovchenko’s gun.. He * walks up to him. *
INDY (cont’d) * I need your bullets. *
Dovchenko laughs. *
DOVCHENKO * Oh-ho-chit mai-y pa-tro-neh.(he wants my * bullets) *
Everyone laughs. Indy walks up to Spalko in something of a rage. * Indy turns to the woman in charge. *
INDY * The contents of that box are highly * magnetized. I need gunpowder. Do you * want my help or not *
She turns, looks and -- *
8.
		5  MOMENTS LATER, -- Dovchenko twists the top off one of the hand grenades dumping *  the gunpowder in Indy’s left hand. * Spalko watches him, curious and impressed. *  Indy moves towards the boxes and climbs to the top . Spalko, Mac * and Dovchenko follow him curios. *  SPALKO * What is the point? (V5D-don’t toy with * me Dr. Jones. What is the point of * this?)  INDY If it’s still magnetic, the metal in * this gunpowder should point the way. *  He reaches the top of the boxes and opens his hand, letting the * gunpowder flies up in a cloud. In mid-air it seems to coalesce, drawn together by an unseen force, and when it lands on the floor it’s in the shape of a line, pointing down one of the aisles. *  Spalko and the group follow Indy. * SPALKO *  Zarim! (move) * 
		6  PART II *  Indy with Spalko, Mac, Dovchenko and the large group of soldiers * come around a corner of boxes into an aisle(cul-de-sac area). *  Indy gets an idea and grabs Dovchenko’s hat from his head. * INDY *  In here. * Two soldiers move forward and come to both sides of Indy and *  begin pouring the powder from two grenades. * They continue to move forward. *  The group comes around another corner into the mouth of the * aisle, it’s jam-packed with crates, stacked to the ceiling. The * soldiers pour for a second time from another two grenades. Indy * comes to a stop following the original line, he lets the powder * in the hat go free. * 
Pliers.
INDY * *
*
8A.
The group looks up as the powder as it flies up in the air and * then comes down in a line and heads down another aisle between a * row of boxes. Indy with the group follow the powder and turn * into... *
Another corner. Again Pasha and the other soldier pour powder * into the hat, but this time from four grenades, they continue * walking. *
Indy climbs up a set of boxes and lets the powder fly free from * the hat. *
Indy turns to the group down below, he sees the shotgun pointing * at him. *
INDY (cont’d) * Shells, give me shotgun shells. *
He climbs down and starts to walk down the middle of the large * aisle- *
DOVCHENKO * Nyet, Hvatit ya emu neveru (No. Enough. * I don’t believe him. I don’t trust him) * to Spalko. *
Spalko gives the order. * SPALKO
Give him the shells. * Another soldier moves up next to Indy and ejects shotgun shells. * The group follows Indy to a row of boxes. *
*
8B.
One of the soldiers hands Indy a set of pliers. The group follow * Indy across to a large set of boxes. Indy throws the hat back to * Dovchenko. Dovchenko catches it and puts it back on. Indy climbs * the boxes all the way to the top, a few of the soldiers with * their rifles follow him. Indy turns and looks at the group. * Spalko moves closer to the boxes. Indy using the pliers opens * the shell and pours the pellets into his hand. He dumps the * pellets on the boxes. *
Spalko watches as the pellets roll down. She looks and sees that * the pellets are going into the boxes. She gets more pellets and * spreads them across the bottom of the boxes. The pellets reach * the base of the stack of crates, roll up the side of it, and * disappear through the crack. Spalko watches them disappear, she * looks at Dovchenko. He gives the orders to bring down the boxes. *
DOVCHENKO * In Russian(everybody come over. Start * your cars-move quickly) *
Indy, pacing, watches form the top as the soldiers with Dovchenko * begin to move the boxes down. The soldiers toss aside several * identical oblong wooden crates. *
A group of army trucks pull into the area. * Spalko gives orders. *
She watches as the soldiers continue to move the boxes. Mac * mutters to himself. *
DOVCHENKO (cont’d) * ETAT (that one) TEPYE ETAT(get that * one. TASHITYE(grab It, pick it up) *
They finally reach the box with the pellets. The soldiers pull * the crate out. The crate’s dimensions are as Spalko descried, * about the size of your average coffin, but a bit thinner. *
SPALKO * Open it! *
One of the soldiers wedges a crowbar into the slot at the side of * the crate and starts to pry the lid open. The crowbar pulls away * from his hand and it gets stuck on the top of the crate. The * other soldiers also begin to pry the crate open. Finally the * slats are pulled away, they reveal a stainless steel tank. *
The soldiers lift it and move towards a vehicle. *
The lights start to move toward the box. Indy watches and begins * to climb down. *
9.
A dozen lights dangling above swing toward the coffin, drawn to * it. Mac looks at the floor, as the steel parts from the broken * crates begin to also move toward the coffin. *
Spalko follows the coffin from behind a line of soldiers. *
The others carry the coffin to the open truck. The dog tags from * their necks are drawn to the magnetism. They are all struggling * with their rifles, trying to keep them from being pulled away by * the coffin. *
Spalko moves to the box on the truck, she tries to feel it with * her hand. Her sward rises towards the box. Spalko brings it down, * she takes it off and hands it to Dovchenko. *
Indy watches from the top of the boxes, he heads down and joins * Mac on the floor. *
One of the soldiers opens the lid, as he does this, his glasses * are pulled off his face and get stuck on the cover. We catch a * glimpse of the stencilling. It’s obscured, but what we can make * out reads-- *
ROSWELL, N.M. 7-9-47 *
Spalko climbs onto the truck, looking into the glass covering, * she opens it. Inside, we see only a shape, wrapped in silvery * metallic wrapping of some kind. *
SPALKO * Fanari.(flashlights) *
Indy is watching with Mac, Indy tries to move closer, the soldier * carrying his whip steps in front of him. His rifle aimed at Indy. *
Spalko gets a knife and begins to cut the bag down the middle. *
As it breaks its seal, there is a HISS and a heavy gas escapes, * swirling. Spalko leans forward, breathless, as at the end of a * long quest. She peels the wrapping away from the top portion of * the shape. The inside of the wrapping holds the shape of what it * was wrapped around -- a humanoid head, somewhat elongated * cranium, and the sygomatic arches of an oversized pair of eyes. *
SPALKO (cont’d) * MOYO- ZOLOTSE(sunshine) *
The Russian Soldiers lean forward, fascinated and distracted-- * Indy looks at Mac, decides to seize the distraction as the * soldier looks back. Indy hits him and GRABS HIS BULLWHIP, hanging * overtheshoulderoftheRussianguardinghim.Heshoulder-blocks * the Russian, who falls back. Spalko stands and looks at Indy. *
10. The Soldier (FRANKLIN) guarding Mac spins his aim toward Indy, *
but -- -- Indy’s bullwhip CRACKS, the lash wraps around the Soldier’s *
tip of his gun-- * -- the fallen Russian (KEVIN)swings his gun around, aiming it at *
Indy --
-- Indy flicks his wrist, causing the 2nd Soldier (FRANKLIN)to * fire his gun, and the bullets --
-- SLAM INTO THE RUSSIAN ON THE GROUND,(Kevin) killing him. * Indy flicks his arm again, causing Mac’s guard to loose the gun, *
Mac catches it-- -- Indy bends down and scoops up the dead Russian’s weapon. *
The remaining Russian Soldiers spin their guns around, but too late -- Indy is standing beside Mac, they’re now back to back, * the old friends, both armed, holding the Russians at bay. Indy * still holding onto his whip under the gun. *
INDY Drop the guns! *
(aiming at Spalko) Or Colonel Doctor Spalko is dead. *
The Soldiers start to lower their weapons, but then something funny happens. Dovchenko smiles. *
And the Soldiers raise their weapons again. Puzzled, Indy turns and sees the last thing he ever expected --
The barrel of Mac’s gun, pointing directly at Indy’s head. INDY (cont’d)
Why Mac? Why? *
MAC What can I say, Jonsy, I’m a capitalist. * And they paid. *
INDY * After all those years we spent spying on * the Reds?! I thought we were friends * Mac. *
*
11. Mac backs away from Indy, moving to the Russians side. *
MAC (shrugs)
Had bad luck with the cards, mate. * Awful. Bloody awful. Can’t go home *
empty-handed no more.
SPALKO No defiant last words, Dr. Jones?
INDY I like Ike.
*
Dovchenko steps forward, CLICKING the slide back on his automatic * handgun.
DOVCHENKO But down gun. *
INDY You got it, pal. *
He pitches the automatic weapon from a height. * The gun hits the floor and fires off a round. The bullet SLAMS
into the concrete, ripping right through --
-- A RUSSIAN SOLDIER’S RIGHT BOOT, blowing off two of his toes. *
As the Soldier SCREAMS, he inadvertently squeezes the trigger on his machine gun, sending a spray of bullets flying into the air, TINGING off trucks, CRUNCHING into crates.
Indy runs out. * Spalko SHOUTS at the nearby Soldiers. *
SPALKO * Dograt Yevo.(go after him) *
Spalko closes the glass case, the soldier takes his glasses off * the cover-Spalko SLAMS the lid of the coffin closed . *
One of the soldiers closes the weapons carrier. * Spalko gets in the driver seat and drives off *
Spalko leaps behind the wheel, hits the gas, and takes off with * it. *
12.
7 ATOP THE CRATES,
Indy turns and runs down the alley, looking for some means of * escape. The soldiers aim their weapons at him. The bullets miss * him. There are stacks of packing crates in ever direction, * different heights, different gaps between them. He comes to the * end looks around, scampers up onto the pile of crates . *
The soldiers emerge from the alley, they spot Indy on top. They * fire, the top crate EXPLODES in a fusillade of gunfire, they * barely missing him again. *
Indy continues chasing Spalko, he CRACKS his whip -- *
-- it wraps around the light, and he swings out over the gap. *
Indy soars over the crates, and catches up to the jeep. *
We, almost. His feet are about to land on the back gate just as * he starts his backward swing --
-- the tip of the bullwhip unravels --
-- and Indy falls backwards, CRASHING into the front seat of another jeep, following the first one, landing right between two Russian Soldiers. He GROANS in pain.
INDY * Damn, I thought that was closer. *
Indy throws an elbow into the face of the Soldier on his right and a punch into the face of the Soldier behind the wheel, they fall out opposite sides of the jeep --
-- and Indy slides behind the wheel and ROARS away down the aisle of the warehouse, chasing Spalko. He catches up, gives the wheel a jerk, and SLAMS her jeep into a pile of crates.
He pushes Spalko’s jeep all the way deep into the boxes, they * disappears. *
She goes flying out of the jeep as it comes to a sudden stop.
Indy leaps out of his own jeep and into Spalko’s, the one carrying the box with his name on it.
The soldiers catch up and surround the area. Suddenly there’s a * huge explosion. The soldiers get thrown up in the air, debris is * flying everywhere. Indy slides out driving the jeep,. He throws * it in gear and takes off, as Spalko comes out and sees him * leaving. *
13. SPALKO *
Sleyduityi zarim. (follow him!) *
Dovchenko in the truck goes after Indy. *
Spalko joins the other soldiers. As she walks away, we see: the * contents of a smashed crate half-exposed on the floor. There’s a * glowinggoldhandleatopabejewelledbox,it’stheArkofthe--- *
8 IN INDY’S JEEP, * he races up to an intersection in the giant warehouse,
Dovechenko’s truck is following him. * He looks back. The truck is gaining on him. * Indy looks ahead and finds himself now HEAD ON with a sedan. * Mac is in the sedan, carrying his rifle. * In the narrow aisle Indy has no other place to go-- * Mac is getting closer. *
MAC * Don’t get clever Boris. No, no, no. You * don’t know him. *
Indy looks up, and sees the hanging lamps, and the latticework of * support beams up there.
Indy starts to climb up and reaches -- * -- for one of the lamps- *
-- Indy’s body is yanked out of the jeep with incredible force. He flies into the air, and beneath him the brakes and Drivers of the two oncoming vehicles SCREAM --
-- and SMASH into Indy’s jeep, front and back, crumpling it like a tin can and CRACKING OPEN the crates that were in the jeep. *
*
13A.
Mac rolls out of the wreckage, he looks up. * Indy is running on the rafters, getting away. * The soldiers begin firing. * BAM-BAM-BAM!!
Indy keeps running as gunshots RIP behind him. * Dovchenko gets out of his truck, and begins firing with his gun. *
He chases Indy. *
Indy runs to the end of the rafters, he jumps on the chains and * slides down. As he gets up, Dovchenko catches up to him and * tackles him....... *
The burst through a door. * As they come out the other side they fall down into a room with *
a glass dome. * They fall on top and continue to fight. Indy manages to punch *
Dovchenko, on the second punch Dovchenko looses his hat. . * The glass begins to crack, it shatters. *
9 INT. BUNKER-DAY Dovchenko and Indy fall
that is held by chains.
They continue fighting, chains. Dovchenko grabs
*
through the glass, and land on a platform * *
Indy is able to roll off and swing by the * onto one of the chains. *
14. Dovchenko is hanging by the chain. Indy flies in on another chain *
and kicks Dovchenko. * Dovchenko goes flying into the control room, crashing through the *
glass window. * He lands hard on a control panel, a red light flashes and a *
buzzer BUZZES. The clock starts the countdown. * Dovchenko gets up, picks up the chain. *
Indy has dropped onto the deck of a railroad flat car, set at the * end of the train tracks that run away into the distance, into an * underground tunnel. There’s a jet engine crudely bolted onto he * deck of the flat car. *
Dovchenko tries to hit Indy with the chain. Indy rolls backwards * off the platform. Dovchenko follows him, trying to hit him with * the chain. Indy tries to get away, he climbs back onto the * platform. *
A set of doors at the tunnel mouth RUMBLE open. * The turbine on the rocket ship starts to spin. *
Dovchenko grabs Indy’s right foot with he chain and pulls him * down onto the steel grate. Indy tries to get up, Dovchenko * punches him. Indy tries again, and again Dovchenko punches him. * Indy tries again, Dovchenko takes the chain and wraps it around * Indy’s neck. *
Dovchenko hauls Indy up by the chain. He starts to punch Indy. * Mac with a group of soldiers carrying their guns, approach from *
the end of an access tunnel behind the flat car. * Indy manages to get his legs around Dovchenko’s neck, he starts *
to choke him as hard as he can. Dov is loosing his breath. * Indy gets his right foot free and kicks Dovchenko down to the *
ground. Indy comes down * The clock is reaching zero. *
15. The soldiers with Mac are just about to reach them *
-- and the jet engine ROARS to life, sending a blast of rippling white fire ERUPTING out of the back of the rocket sled (because that what this gizmo is), incinerating the Russian soldiers. *
Mac recoils from the blast and the engine fully engages -- boy, does it engage, SLAMMING Indy and Dovchenko flying into a cushioned blast shield near the back of the railroad car.
The rocket sled blasts away down the railroad tracks so fast it’s just a streak of light and ZOOMS into the tunnel. *
		10  IN THE TUNNEL, *  lights strobe by as the rocket sled picks up speed in the * underground tunnel. Indy and Dovchenko are pinned to the rear * blast shield by the intense thrust. * 
		11  EXT HANGAR 51 DUSK *  As dusk falls, we see the blurry fire of the rocket sled as it * BLASTS out the mouth of the tunnel, moving like a shooting star * down five miles of tracks, disappearing into the distance. * 
11A INT GUARD SHACK DUSK * An MP watching the rocket, he makes a call. *
GUARD * I need to speak to the colonel. *
A second later, there’s a sonic BOOM. 12 INT HANGAR 51 DUSK
Back in the hangar, Russian Soldiers are picking up the coffin. * Spalko SHOUTS to them in Russian, pointing out the open hangar door, go after them!
SPALKO * Shivilyties. (move) Poidyomte (let’s go) *
Mac out of breath joins her. The soldiers load the coffin in the * jeep. Spalko gets in the driver seat of the remaining jeep. Mac * joins her in the passenger seat. *
SPALKO (cont’d) * You did well. *
The drive off. * Tlfhhld
15A.
		13  EXT ROCKET SLED NIGHT *  On the rocket sled, Indy and Dovchenko hold on for dear life as the G forces wrap their faces around the backs of their skulls.  The desert landscape flashes by; they cover miles in moments, and as abruptly as it started --  -- the booster engine shuts down. The rocket sled silently glides to a halt at the end of the five mile stretch of railroad tracks, coming to a stop with a soft little THUMP into a rubber bumper at the end, next to a small shack with lights on.  On the flat car, Indy and Dovchenko. Indy comes to, he pushes * Dovchenko off the flat car. *  Indy gets up, holding onto his whip, he tries to regain his * balance, he grabs his hat and looses his footing, he falls off on * the other side of the flat car. *  In the distance, Indy spies a plume of dust from the Russian cars, which are pursuing him.  He takes off into the distance on wobbly lets, headed for a rocky rise that might provide some cover. 
		14  EXT HANGAR 51 DUSK  Outside the front entrance to Hangar 51, another truck, this one full of REAL U.S. MARINES, alerted by the noise of the rocket sled, SCREECHES to a halt. The marines leap out, drawing their weapons, and cautiously approach the entrance to the hangar. 
Indy watches from behind the hill.
Dovchenko, on the flat car, is just coming to. from the sedan tend to him, Dovchenko SHOUTS to gesturing in the direction Indy ran -- get him!
Three Russians jump back into the jeep and take the desert.

Indy races into the living room, where the music is louder. It’s the theme from the Howdy Doody Show. A family (MOM, DAD, and TWO KIDS) is seated with their backs to him, watching Howdy on the black and white TV set. *

Indy, exhausted, is in a decontamination room He’s surrounded by FOUR SOLDIERS in medical gowns and goggles who are scrubbing him roughly with long-handled brushes.
Two shadowy men in dark suits and skinny ties, SMITH and TAYLOR, stand a short distance away, regarding him suspiciously. A SMALL MAN with a Geiger counter waves a metal wand across Indy’s body. There are few, if any, CLICKS.
A SOLDIER IN UNIFORM enters and hands smith a paper. He enters * the room. Indy is seated on a table, Taylor is standing on the * other side. *
SMITH Your story appears to check out. But * I’m still mystified, Dr. Jones, as to why you were in the Russian car in the first place.

What was in that steel box they took? *
TAYLOR (AS HE LEANS ON THE *
TABLE) You tell us. You’ve seen it before. *
INDY * You mean that Air force fiasco in ‘47?

room -- GENERAL ROSS. Around Indy’s age, big man, big voice.
GENERAL ROSS Indy, thank God! Don’t you know it’s * dangerous to climb into a refrigerator? * Those things are death traps!
Ross is smiling, he’s kidding. Indy smiles back.
INDY Good to see you too, Bob.
GENERAL ROSS (to Smith and Taylor)
Relax, boys, I can vouch for Dr. Jones.
INDY (to Ross)
What the hell’s going on? KGB on American soil? Who was that woman? *
TAYLOR Describe her.
INDY * Tall, thin, mid-thirties. She carried * a sword of some kind -- a rapier, I * think. Knew how to use it, too. *
Smith and Taylor exchange a look -- they recognize that * description. Taylor steps out of the room quickly. *
Through a glass panel, we see Taylor, outside the room, pick up a * phone and make a call. *

Ross produces a file from his briefcase and flips it open, * showing Indy a surveillance photograph of Spalko. Indy picks up * the file and looks at it. *

You’re sure she’s here?
INDY Here and gone. Who is she?
Smith doesn’t answer Indy. But General Ross does. *
GENERAL ROSS Irina Spalko, Stalin’s fair-haired girl. * His favorite scientist, if you can call psychic research science.
Smith steps in, trying to end this conversation. Indy looks * through the file. *
SMITH General Ross.
GENERAL ROSS She’s leading teams from the Kremlin all

SMITH Nothing yet. But frankly, your
association with George McHale calls into question all your activities, including those during the war.
GENERAL ROSS are you nuts? Do you have any idea how
many medals this son of a bitch has won?
SMITH A great many, I’m sure. But does he
deserve them?
TAYLOR Dr. Jones, let’s just say for now that
you are of interest to the Bureau.
SMITH Of great interest.
INDY Look, you got any doubts about me, talk
to congressman Freleng. Or Abe Portman in Army Intel. Hell, ask anybody, I’ve got a lot of friends in Washington!

He steps into the hall, closing the door behind him. The STUDENTS lean forward to hear what’s going on outside.
The Students look up sharply. Indy and the Dean are visible through the glass; Indy looks like he’s going to clobber him.
33 OUT IN THE HALLWAY, Stanforth’s trying to calm him.
STANFORTH You have no idea the pressure coming
from the Board of Regents. The FBI showed up this morning, they ransacked your office, searched all your files --
INDY And you didn’t stop them? You’re the
dean of this college, they have no right! *
STANFORTH They had every right! They weren’t
vandals, they were federal agents with search warrants. The University’s not going to let itself be embroiled in that kind of controversy, not in this * charged climate. *

Indy is folding a shirt, he puts it in a suitcase that’s on the bed in Indy’s bedroom.
Stanforth is standing in the archway. They’re halfway through a bottle of red wine, middle of the afternoon.
STANFORTH Where will you go?
INDY Train to New York, overnight to London,
for starters. Might end up teaching in Leipzig, Heinrich owes me a favor.
Indy moves to the closet, opens up one of the drawers and takes out some clothes. He moves back to the bed.
INDY (cont’d) I’ll wire you when I get settled and you
can send the rest of my things
He goes back to the closet and gets a couple of belts, he walks back to the packing.
STANFORTH I suppose there’s nothing to keep you
here. I barely recognize this country anymore, the government’s got us seeing communists in our soup. When the hysteria reaches academia, I guess it’s time to call it a career.
Indy picks up his glass and moves to the living room.
INDY How’d Deirdre take the news?
Stanforth follows.
STANFORTH How does any wife take such things? The
look on her face was a combination of pride and panic.
Stanforth finishes his drink. Indy moves to his desk and opens the drawers.
INDY I never should have doubted you, my
friend.
29.
STANFORTH We seem to be at the age where life stops
giving us things and starts taking them away.
Pause. Wow, bummer. Then they both snap out of it at the same time, Indy bolting up to resume packing while Stanforth reaches for the wine.
STANFORTH (cont’d) Maybe just another half a glass...
Indy goes to his desk and rifles through some papers, takes a few, including his passport, throws out some others.
STANFORTH (cont’d) I wish you’d met someone like Deirdre,
to help you through times like this. Or if you’d realized it when you did meet her...
INDY Let’s not tug on that thread right now,
okay pal? Stanforth holds his hands up in surrender, okay, I’ll drop it. He notices his watch.
STANFORTH Good Lord, I’ve got to get home. Don and
Maggie are driving spousum et familia up from the city for dinner. Emergency family council meeting.
INDY (with a touch of envy)
They’re good kids.
STANFORTH Healthy and employed, I’ll settle for
that. I’m off. (stands, sways from the wine)
And I believe I should walk.
INDY Thank you for what you did, my friend.

They move towards the door.
STANFORTH the Regents were stunned into shamed

Indy opens the front door. Stanforth turns to Indy with one last thought.
STANFORTH (cont’d) you know, when you’re young you spend
all your time thinking “Who will I be?” And for years you’re busy shouting at the world “this is who I am!” But lately I’ve been wondering -- after I’m gone, who will they say I was?

Saturday afternoon. Letter sweaters, saddle shoes, a juke box playing “Wake up Little Suzie” Mostly COLLEGE TYPES in the place, but a dozen GREASERS in the back drinking beer, looking for trouble.
A LETTERMEN walks up to the jukebox about to select a song. One of the GREASERS puts his hand on his head and spins around, the Lettermen walks back to his table
Indy and Mutt are in the diner, a waitress pours coffee at their table
Mutt turns his hat over and picks up a photograph hands it to Indy. CLOSE ON a photograph of Mutt, a few years younger, standing next to a BOOKISH MAN in his mid-fifties, more buttoned- down than the second floor of Brooks Brothers.
INDY (O.S.) I haven’t talked to Harold Oxley in
twenty years. We lost touch. We had a falling out. He cut me off, angry about something or other. I never found out about what it was. Too bad, he’s a brilliant guy. He could put you to sleep by talking though.
MUTT when I was a kid, that’s how I did get to
sleep. The Ox was better than a glass of warm milk.(offers his hand) Name’s Mutt Williams.
INDY “Mutt?” What kind of name is that?
MUTT It’s the one I picked, you got a problem
with that?
INDY Take it easy. What was Oxley your uncle
or something? (what was your relationship to Oxley?)
MUTT Kind of. My dad died in the war and the
Ox helped my mom raise me.
He pulls a comb from his back pocket and dips it in a glass of coke on the table next to him. He runs it through his carefully kept hair.
32A.
INDY You said they were going to kill him.
Mutt puts his comb away and leans in closer to Indy.
MUTT About six months ago my mom got a letter
from the Ox. He was down in Peru. He said he found some kind of skull, crystal skull, like the one that guy Mitchell- Hodgkins, Mitchell-Hodgkins found.
Akator? Akator. He said that? Are you sure?
MUTT Akator, that’s what he said. (or)Yeah. What is it?
33.
He turns and grabs a bottle of beer off the tray of a WAITRESS serving the table next to them. (She doesn’t see.)
INDY The Ox and I were obsessed with the
Mitchell-Hedges skull when we were in college. How do you know about it?
Indy takes the beer from Mutt and puts it back on the Waitress’s tray. (She doesn’t see that either.)
MUTT You kidding? Ox could talk about that
thing till the cows came home. That’s all he talked about. What was it, like an idol?
INDY It’s a deity carving. Meso-American.
There’s a few crystal skulls in the world. I saw one in the British Museum. They’re impressive craftsmanship, but that’s about it.
MUTT Oxley said the skull had psychic powers.
INDY Like, “Stare into its eyes and it’ll
drive you crazy?”
MUTT Laugh all you want, but Ox said he found
it this time. This was real, and he was on his way to a place called Akator with it.
Indy sits forward -- now he’s interested.
INDY
MUTT
INDY
33A.
INDY It’s a mythical, a lost city in the
Amazon. The Conquistadors called it El Dorado. Supposedly the Ugha tribe were chosen by the gods 7,000 years ago to build a great(giant) city out of solid gold.

INDY (cont’d) With aqueducts, paved roads, technology
that wouldn’t be sees again for another five thousand years. Francesco de Orellana disappeared into the Amazon looking for it in 1546. I almost died(myself) of typhus(myself) looking for it. I don’t think it exists.
MUTT Why would Ox want to take the skull
there?
INDY The legend says that a crystal skull was
stolen from Akator in the fifteenth or sixteenth century. That whoever returns this skull to the city’s temple will be given control over its power.(powers)
MUTT Power? (powers) (so there is some kind
of power)What kind of power? INDY
I don’t know, kid. It’s just a story.
MUTT From his letter, my mom thought the Ox
was off his rocker. (taps his head) Smog in the noggin’. Goes down to find him, only he had already been kidnapped, and now they’ve got her too. Ox hid(buried) the skull somewhere, and if my mom doesn’t come up with it, they’re gonna kill ‘em both. She said you’d help me.
INDY Me? What’s your mom’s name, again?
MUTT Mary, Mary williams. You remember her?
INDY There were a lot of Mary’s, kid.
Mutt slams the table and gets up.
MUTT Shut up, man, your talking about my
mother. That’s my mother. Don’t, alright, that’s my mother!
34A.
INDY Look, you don’t have to get sore all the
time to prove how tough you are, okay? Sit down, relax, please sit down. You want my help or not?
35.
MUTT My mom said if anybody could find the
skull it’s you. Like you’re some type of grave robber or something.
INDY I’m a teacher.(I’m a professor) ( I’m a
tenure professor)
MUTT You’re a teacher. (perfect- just our
luck, just my luck you’re a teacher. You’re a teacher that’s a big help. That should be a big help. You’re a teacher great I love teachers) She called me two weeks ago from South America, told me she escaped but they were after her. She said she’d just mailed me a letter from the Ox, and I was suppose to give it to you. Then the line went dead.
Mutt pulls an envelope from his jacket and gives it to Indy, who opens it and pulls out a single page.
MUTT (cont’d) I opened it. It’s pointless the thing’s
gibberish, though, it’s not even English lettering.
INDY Wait a minute.
He nods toward the soda counter-- the two bulky Guys from the train station have followed them here.
INDY (cont’d) Those two bricks over at the counter.
Are not here for the milkshakes.
He follows their gaze down to the letter he holds in his hand. They seem awfully interested in it, suddenly alert.
Indy folds the letter and slips it in his jacket pocket as the bulky Guys approach the table.
MUTT who are they?
INDY I don't know. Maybe FBI.
The Bulky Guys arrive at the table. They speak with Russian accents.
RUSSIAN 1 Come quietly, Dr. Jones.

Both Russians take out their handguns pointing out from their jackets.
INDY (cont’d) -- to a gunfight.

Outside. Now. Indy puts his hat on and grabs his briefcase. Mutt picks up his
hat, and puts his knife away. They both start to move out.
The Russians lead them across the crowded diner, walking slowly behind them, their hands inside their coats menacingly.
Indy looks around, thinking wildly.

She punches Mutt, and then the Letterman punches Mutt.
Mutt lands next to the GREASERS, they take off their glasses and get ready.
Indy grabs the girl and pushes her aside, he hurls his suitcase pushes a table, it falls blocking the Russians.
The Russians see what’s happening and try to move through the crowd, towards Indy, -- Indy sees them approaching, he puts his hat on one of the students and ducks.

Somebody’s tossed into the jukebox; “Wake up Little Suzie changes over to “Shake, Rattle and Roll.”
Mutt and Indy take off, headed for the front door.
The Russians fight to get to Indy and Mutt but it’s chaos now and they can’t get to them before they’re out the door.
38.
39 INT ALLEY DAY
Indy and Mutt race down the sidewalk, where Mutt’s motorcycle is parked. Mutt, putting on his gloves, leaps on board, Indy thinks, fast:
INDY Your mom didn’t escape, they let her go.
So she could mail the letter, and you could bring it to me and I could translate it.
MUTT (kicks it to life with a ROAR)
Get on Grumps, time to cut out!
Indy has no choice but to hop on the bike. Mutt hits the gas and the bike kicks a wheelie as it ROARS out of the alley.
The Russians finally make it out of the diner. A girl grabs hold of Russian #1’s neck. He throws her off, they look around, see hem at the bikes.
They run down the sidewalk.
The Russian sedan’s SCREECH around a corner and pull up to them. They get in, the cars roar out after them.
38A.
		40  ON BOARD THE BIKE,  Indy clings to Mutt as the kid races through the used-to-be- peaceful American streets. They’re putting distance between themselves and the Russian sedan, but now a --  -- SECOND SEDAN ROARS out of a side street and pulls up alongside them on the left. The sedan edges over toward Mutt, both driving at high speed.  DIMITRI * BLIZHEI! (closer) *  Mutt’s got no room to maneuver, they’re squeezing him up alongside a speeding bus, they’re getting crushed. RUSSIAN ARMS * reach out the open back window of the sedan. *  Indy turns and punches Dimitri, his hat flies off. The Russian * grabs hold of Indy -- *  DIMITRI * SVOLOCH! (bastard) TEPER TRIMOI!(now * you’re mine) *  -- and drag him right off the motorcycle! 
		41  INT RUSSIAN CAR DAY  Indy gets hauled into the back seat of the Russian sedan, but he KICKS the driver, knocking off his hat, then turns and PUNCHES * DIMITRI, until he knocks him out. Indy crawls, toward the open * window on the other side of the seat.  THROUGH THE BACK WINDOW,  we can see Mutt drop behind the car, then gun the bike and speed up, approaching the left side of the sedan.  Indy gets a hold of the window frame and boosts himself out of * the window-- * 
		42  EXT STREET DAY -- and is hanging half out of the car when Mutt ROARS up  alongside him.  Indy grabs onto the motorcycle but doesn’t quite nail the landing. Hanging onto the bar on the back of the seat, he’s dragged behind the motorcycle for a good fifty yards before Mutt sees what’s going on -- * 
39.
-- TAPS the brakes --
-- and Indy sails up into the air, over the slowing motorcycle, SLAMS into Mutt’s back, and lands hard on the seat behind him.
The bus and sedan continue down the street as the bike peels off * across oncoming traffic and through an iron gate. The black sedan * follows crashing through the closing iron gate, breaking off the * gate on one side as it goes through. *
The bike and sedan#2 continue through the courtyard and the bike * leads the sedan through an archway tunnel and into another open * area. *
The sedan continues chasing the bike up to the point where the * bike goes through a narrow passageway with a gothic arch. The * passageway is too narrow and the sedan has to stop. The sedan * then backs away from the passageway. *
The bike continues on through a series of archway passages as * people jump out of the way. *
At the end of the last archway the bike enters the flow of * traffic again. *
The sedan chases the bike again as it re-enters traffic until the * bike turns off the road... *
Onto a smaller walkway, and then turns off the walkway and goes * up the stairs into the library. *
The sedan stops and then backs out. *
44 EXT BUSY STREET DAY *
-- onto a busy street, where Mutt guns it. The #1 sedan his at * the corner and sees them drive by. Dimitri yells at the driver to * follow them. The sedan is immediately on them again giving chase *
as Mutt heads for:
He drives through another archway and into an open field in middle of the buildings.
45 THE CENTER OF TOWN,
where there’s a demonstration going on, a SPEAKER, banners, placards. The motorcycle zips neatly through them, but the isn’t so nimble.
A STUDENT leaps out of the way of the sedan and his placard across the windshield.
*
the * *
*
sedan SLAPS
39A.
INSIDE THE SEDAN,
we can read the placards--as they hit the windshield. *
Mutt gets the idea to run over the large “BETTER DEAD THAN RED” * SIGN. He runs the motorcycle through the pole, the sign falls on * the windshield. The car drives blindly, it tears apart. *
		46  OMITTED * 
		47  OMITTED * 
40. 48 The car SMASHES into the base of a statue of Marcus Brody. *
The crash causes the head of the statue to break off, it rolls * down and crashes through the windshield. It lands on the driver’s * lap. *
Mutt and Indy watch. Mutt is happy with himself. The second sedan * appears out of the nearby archway. Mutt takes off, the sedan * chases after them. *
As Mutt ROARS AWAY, Dimitri and the driver get out of the car. * The driver hands the head to Dimitri, he drops the head. *
*
40A. 43 INT LIBRARY DAY *
-- the school library. The bike ROARS into the main reading * room, sending books and magazines flying into the air. STUDENTS * dive out of the way, Indy SHOUTS . *
INDY * This is the library, you’re going too * fast! *
MUTT * Hey, hey! Split, split. Move, move, get * out of the way! *
Students dive out of the way, one student carrying an armload of * books is standing still, he screams. *
Mutt sees him and also screams, he turns, just missing the * student. His wheels spin out from under him and the bike lays * down, right in the middle of the reading room. *
Mutt and Indy slide across the room , crashing under the tables. * They come to a stop, right in front of a seated student. *
STUDENT * Excuse me, Dr. Jones. *
INDY * Yes. *
STUDENT * I’ve got a quick question about * Hargrove’s normative culture models -- *
Mutt gets up, Indy hops on the back of the bike. *
INDY * Forget Hargrove. Read Vere Gordon * Childe on diffusionism, he spent most of * his life in the field. *
Mutt kicks the bike’s starter and it ROARS back to life. *
INDY (cont’d) * If you wanna be a good archaeologist you * gotta -- *
Mutt guns it and the bike takes off, Indy SHOUTING back -- * INDY (cont’d) *
-- GET OUT OF THE LIBRARY! * The bike ROARS away *
41. 49 EXT INDY’S HOUSE DUSK *
Indy goes to the bookshelves. He pulls down a thick book, flips to a section in the middle. He moves to the couch. Mutt is looking around.
MUTT is this your pad? It’s the first place
they’ll look for us, we should get out of here!
INDY Just give me a minute.
Indy sits and pulls Oxley’s letter from his pocket and studies it. He pulls a pair of glasses from his pocket and slips them on. He compares the symbols there with the symbols in Oxley’s letter. Mutt looks at himself in the mirror, he starts to comb his hair.
INDY (cont’d) Just what I thought so. Koihoma.
MUTT What’s that?
INDY An extinct Latin American language. (he
grabs a small journal and a pencil) Pre- Columbian syllabary system. See these diagonal stresses on the ideogams? Definitely Koihoma.
MUTT You speak it?
Mutt takes out a stick of gum and begins to chew.
INDY Nobody speaks it, it hasn’t been heard
out loud in three thousand years. Might be able to read a little --
He flips to another page, further in the book, also covered with ancient symbols. He MUTTERS to himself, comparing the two pages and scribbling on the journal.
INDY (cont’d) -- if I walk it through Mayan first.
42.
MUTT You know, for an old man, you ain’t bad
in a fight.
INDY Thanks a lot.
MUTT So what are you, like eighty?
Still working, Indy laughs through the desire to punch Mutt in the face. Doesn’t look at him.
INDY Hard livin’, kid. I am not recommending
it. He holds up the page he’s written, reading from it.
INDY (cont’d) “Follow the lines in the earth that only
the gods can read which lead to Orellana’s cradle, guarded by the living
dead.” (an idea)
Only the gods can read. He’s talking about the Nazca Lines.
MUTT What are those?
Indy stands and goes back to the book shelf.
INDY Geoglyphs. Here we go.
He finds the book and walks back to Mutt, he flips through it, searching for a certain page.
INDY (cont’d) Giant ancient drawings, scratched into
the desert floor in Peru. From the ground they don’t look like anything, but from the air (sky)-- ah!
He spins the book around to face Mutt, who bends over to examine it. Two whole pages are devoted to serial photographs of beautiful carvings in the Peruvian desert. One looks like a monkey, another like a spider, a hummingbird -- and a large- headed humanoid figure.
43.
INDY (cont’d) Only the gods can read them, because the
gods -- (gesturing)
-- live up there.(this is before airplanes) Oxley’s telling us the skull is in Nazca, Peru. And it’s a good bet the Russians are the ones who have him. The Kremlin probably think the skull has some potential as a weapon, that’s why they’re after it.
MUTT If it gets my mom back, they can have it.
Let’s go, and try not to slow me down. Mutt starts to head for the door, but Indy is thinking
INDY Akator. That would be the find of a
lifetime. Indy moves to the bedroom
INDY (cont’d) Create a reputation no politician could
touch. 50 INT INDY’S BEDROOM DUSK
BAM! Indy SMACKS open the closet door in his bedroom. His hat is still there, in the foreground, and the whip is curled on the top shelf, the handle sticking out.
43A.
RETAKE 8-31-07- INT. INDY’S HOUSE- DUSK
MUTT So what are you , like, eighty?
Still working, Indy looks up holding the letter.
INDY It’s a riddle. Leave it to Oxley to write
a riddle in a dead language. “Follow the lines in the earth that only the gods can read which led to Orellana’s cradle, guarded by the living dead.”(an Idea- he gets up) he’s talking about the Nazca Lines.
Indy walks to back to the bookshelf.
MUTT What are those? (what are they?)
Indy grabs a large book.
INDY Here we go. Geoglyphs.
He walks back to Mutt, flips through it, finds the page. Two whole pages are devoted to aerial photographs of beautiful carvings in the Peruvian desert. One looks like a monkey, another like a spider, a hummingbird -- and a large headed humanoid figure.
INDY (cont’d) Giant ancient drawings, carved into the
desert floor in Nazca Peru. From the ground they don’t look like much(anything) but from the sky-- (he takes his glasses off) Only the gods can read, because only gods- (gesturing) live up there. Oxley’s telling us the skull is in Nazca, Peru. And it’s a good bet the Russians have him. The Kremlin probably thinks the skull has some potential as a weapon, that’s why they’re after it.
MUTT Look teach, if it gets my mom back, they
can have whatever they want. Let’s go(let’s split)
Mutt starts to head for the door, but Indy is thinking and stops him.
INDY He moves to his bedroom.
INDY (cont’d) Akator. It would be the find of a
lifetime. He goes to the closet.
INDY (cont’d) Create a reputation no politician could
touch. Indy picks up his hat- CLOSE ON THE HAT!
Akator.

51 BEGIN TRAVEL MONTAGE. A series of dissolves takes place against a moving map with an *
animated red line.
		51A  From the East Coast they make their way southwest to Mexico City, *  Mexico City airport *  Mutt’s motorcycle is being carted towards the cargo hold of a * ‘PANAGRA’ plane. Mutt watches them, Indy tips one of the workers. * Indy carries a rucksack. *

44. 10/15/07
52 EXT NAZCA DAY The windswept desert city of Nazca is like Casablanca -- teaming,
international, dangerous. And hot. Always, everywhere, hot.
Mutt’s motorcycle is chained to a metal post outside a cantina at the edge of a town square. Mutt’s at an outdoor table beside it, finishing a bottle of Coke, adding it to a pyramid of five others in front of him. Looks bored, he’s been there a while.
Indy is nearby, speaking to a couple LOCALS in Spanish, getting an animated story from them. He finishes and rejoins Mutt.
INDY Finally -- they saw him. Ox came
wondering into town a few months ago, raving like a mad man. The police locked him up in a sanitarium. It’s this way.
MUTT Me motto.
He starts walking. Mutt falls into stride alongside him.
MUTT (CONT’D) I took Spanish, man, I didn’t understand
a word of that. What was it?
INDY Quechua. Local Incan dialect.
MUTT Where’s you learn that one?
INDY Long story.
MUTT I got time.
INDY I rode with Pancho villa. A couple of his
guys spoke it.
*
45.
MUTT Bull-shit!
INDY You asked.
MUTT Pancho Villa?
INDY Technically, I was kidnapped.
MUTT By Pancho Villa?
INDY It was the fight against Victoriano
Huerta. Indy SPITS on the ground at the mention of Huerta’s name.
MUTT How old were you ?
INDY ‘bout your age.
MUTT Your parents musta lost it, huh?.
INDY thins were -- a little tense at home.
MUTT Things are a little tense between me and
my mom right now.
INDY Treat her right, kid, you only get one.
(muttered) And sometimes not for long.
MUTT It ain’t my problem(my fault), it’s
hers. She got P.O.ed cause I quit school, like I’m some kind of goof or cause I quit school.
INDY You quit school?
45A.
MUTT Sure, tons of ‘em. Fancy prep schools.
Teach you chess, debate, fencing: I’m great with a blade. I just think it’s a waste of time.
46.
INDY You never finished?
MUTT Nah, it’s all useless skills and the
wrong books. I mean, I love reading, Ox made me read all the time. Now I can pick ‘em myself, you get me.
INDY What do you do for money?
MUTT Fix motorcycles.
INDY Plan on doing that forever?
MUTT Maybe I will, teach. You got a problem
with that?
INDY No, not if that’s what you love doing,
don’t let anybody tell you any different.
As they head toward the hulking sanitarium at the end of the street, the brim of a Panama hat rises in the foreground.
Somebody’s watching them. The head turns, and we get a good look at him as Indy and Mutt walk away.
It’s Indy’s old friend Mac.
CUT TO:
53 EXT SANITARIUM DAY The looming facade of the sanitarium. Indy and Mutt walk toward
it, and Indy reads the words carved over the door.
INDY Saint Anthony de Padua.(this is it)-
(here we are) (sees the irony)
The patron saint of lost things.
46A.
RETAKE 8-31-07 -A PERUVIAN NUN opens a gate, Indy and Mutt enter. She speaks in Spanish, Indy translates, while Mutt trails them. They head down the steps into a corridor in the sanitarium.
PERUVIAN NUN (IN SPANISH) Ne se donde esta el, pero te voy a mostrar la celda. Vinieron hombres
armados. Hombres malos y se lo llevaron. (I don’t know where he is, I will take you to his cell. Armed men came. Bad men and they took him) Estaba obsesionado con la pintura, pintaba toda las paredes al borde de la locura. ( he was obsessed with painting, he painted all the walls, he was crazy)
INDY She says Ox, he’s not here now(he isn’t
here)She’s going to show us the cell. She doesn’t know where he is(where he want) some men came and took him away, man with guns. She says Oxley was obsessed, deranged, drew pictures all over the wall of the cell.
Indy and the Nun continue down the corridor.
PERUVIAN NUN Estaba obsesinado con la pintura.
Pintaba todas las paredes. Lo Dejo hasta el borde de la locura.
INDY She says he was obsessed, deranged, he
drew pictures all over the walls of his cell.
MUTT looks into the cells, freaked out by the INMATES behind the bars on either side of the stone hallway.
CARLOS El sabia que se me pegaba.(he knew it was
sticking to me) y lo pique, lo pique, lo pique( and I stabbed him, and stabbed him , and stabbed him)
The Nun moves ahead to a certain cell and begins to open the lock. Indy takes out Oxley’s letter. He and Mutt stand nearby .
46B.
INDY This riddle of Oxley’s makes no
sense”...follow the lines only the gods can read leads to Orellana’s cradle.” Cradle? Cradle? birth, Orellana wasn’t born in Peru, he was born in Spain. He
was a Conquistador, he came here for gold.
MUTT What happened to him?
INDY Disappeared along with six others. Their
bodies were never found. The nun unlocks the door--
Indy and Mutt enter the cell.
47. 54 INT SANITARIUM DAY
Indy and Mutt walk down an endless corridor in the sanitarium, led by a PERUVIAN NUN.
She and Indy converse in whispered Spanish while Mutt trails them, freaked out by the INMATES behind the bars on either side of the stone hallway. SCRATCHY CLASSICAL MUSIC plays on an old record player.
NUN Este hombre ha pasado todo el limite de
la locura. Esta completamente obsesionado. La obsesion fue tan grande. que ha pasado el limite de la locura. Esta completamente obsesionado de la pintura. No Ha dejado una pared sin pintar. Todo parece loco. Obsesionado Hay Professor Jones esta completamente transtornado. Ha pintado todas las paredes. Es una obseion qui tiene con las pinturas. La obsesion de este hombre come esta transtornado no se puede explicar. Su mente esta totalmente transtornada. Esta obsesionado con las pinturas en las paredes. A pintado de dia y de noche. A dejado todo pintoado.
Indy takes out Oxley’s letter and reads it.
Suddenly one of the inmates lunges forward and grabs Mutt by the jacket, he has his hands on Mutt, pulling him toward them until --
-- Indy’s hand clamps down on Mutt’s jacket and pulls him free.
The Inmate yells , in Spanish, it’s as if he’s speaking in tongues-- some clear some not.
INMATE El venia pero you no podia v er y llegaba
la sangre. Acercaba. Agarre y lo picaba y lo picaba y me quieria matar y lo picaba y lo picaba. El caia ensima de mi.
The Nun moves quickly out of the way, Indy and Mutt follow her.
INDY She says Oxley was deranged. Obsessed.
He drew pictures all over the walls of his cell.
What?
MUTT
47A. 10/17/07
INDY (cont’d) “...follow the lines only the gods can
read... leads to Orellana’s cradle.”(musing to himself)
INDY “...follow the lines only the gods can
read leads to Orellana’s cradle.”
Cradle? Makes no sense, Orellana wasn’t born in Peru, he was born in Spain. He was a Conquistador, he came here looking for gold.
MUTT What happened to him?
INDY Disappeared along with six others.
Their bodies were never found. The nun stops at a certain cell, unlocks it --
55 INT CELL DAY
-- and swings the metal door wide open. Indy and Mutt step into the room, which is about twenty feet square. Very spare, a cot, a sink, two small windows, and a stone floor.
But what immediately catches their attention is the walls.
The lady wasn’t kidding, Oxley was obsessed, and has indeed drawn pictures on the stone walls of his cell.
Pictures of the Crystal Skull.
48.
They’re EVERYWHERE. Big versions, small ones, abstracts -- dozens and dozens of drawings of the skull, smothering the four walls. The far wall is one great big drawing, and Ox has used the small square windows for the skull’s eyes.
MUTT Ox, man, what happened to you?
Indy turns, notices the emotion on Mutt’s face. He watches him for a moment, realizing the depth of his connection with Oxley. Mutt notices Indy noticing and turns away, embarrassed.
Indy looks back to the drawings, studying them. In the profile drawings, the back of the head is elongated.
INDY This isn’t anything like the Mitchell-
Hedges skull. Look at the cranium-- the elongation.
There’s something else written on the walls of the cell -- a series of words, but not different words, they’re:
INDY (cont’d) the same word, over and over, in
different languages. Mutt finds one in Spanish and translates:
MUTT “Return.” Return where?
INDY Or “what.”
in front of his face.
Sweep.
INDY
49.
MUTT You mean the skull?
Indy gestures to the drawings, makes the understatement of the year.
INDY Seemed to be on his mind.
MUTT Where was he supposed to return it to?
He goes back down to his notes, studying the lines from the letter that he transcribed.
Indy looks down. At the floor. He notices something. Drops to his knees and runs his fingertips across the floor. He finds a groove there, something scratched in the floor.
He traces along the line, finds another, and another, somebody has carved lines into the soft stone floor!
		56  BACK OUT IN THE HALLWAY, Indy grabs a broom from the Janitor’s cart. 
		57  BACK IN THE CELL, BAM! The broom flies at Mutt, who catches it with one hand, right 
Indy goes to the far wall and starts to climb it, hoisting himself up onto the window ledge, then climbing to the next ledge, getting higher and higher.
When Indy’s a good ten feet off the ground, he turns back, looking at the area Mutt has swept clean.
INDY (cont’d) Ox didn’t mean Orellana’s birthplace-
cradle means more than one thing in Mayan, literally it’s resting place, as in ‘final’ resting place. He meant his grave, and that ---drawing he scratched into the floor
50.
Through the cloud of dust and dirt, we can see a drawing’s been carved into the floor of the cell, but this elaborate rendering isn’t a skull, it has the jagged peaks of burial temples and gravestones.
INDY (cont’d) -- is the cemetery where he’s buried.
MUTT but you said Orellana vanished. Nobody
ever found his grave.
INDY Looks like Harold Oxley did.
As we stare at this outline of a specific cemetery a FLASH OF LIGHTNING --
MATCH DISSOLVE TO:
50A.
		58  EXT CHAUCHILLA CEMETERY NIGHT  Mutt covers his motorcycle, in the moonlight. He is holding a * backpack and a flashlight, he walks up the steps and joins Indy. *  Indy finds two shovels. * A hand-painted sign on a gate CREAKS in the wind: *  MATAREMOS A LOS HUAQUEROS!  Mutt reads the sign: * MUTT *  “Grave robbers will be shot!” * Indy grins. *  INDY * Good thing we’re not grave robbers. *  He throws the one of the shovels to Mutt. * Lightning CRACKS behind him. *  He turns and walks into the cemetery, as he goes through the * archway. Mutt follows reluctantly. * 
		59  DEEPER IN THE CEMETERY, *  half the graves have been strip mined, pillaged over the years, * revealing skeletons in bizarre burial postures. There are other * skeletons strewn about, the place is in a state of disrepair. * Two skeletons have been leaned up against grave markers, right * out in the open. *  It’s dark, Indy and Mutt lit only by the moon and the flickering * glow from the flashlight. Dirt and sand blow everywhere. As * they march against the wind. They walk in deeper into the * cemetery. *  Chauchilla Cemetery is on a cliffside, partially eroded from * below, leaving a promontory. It’s nighttime, a thunderstorm * blowing in. Lightning CRACKS, and in that flash we see the Nazca * lines, lit up on the desert floor hundreds of feet below.. *  A SHADOWY FIGURE, which has blended into the branches, seems to * materialize right out of the tree. Catlike in his grace but * definitely human, he slinks across the tree branch, following * Indy and Mutt into the cemetery. * 
*
51. MUTT *
What are we looking for?
INDY I don’t know yet. Something that * doesn’t look right. Maybe an * antechamber off one of these open * barrows. *
One of the skeleton creatures moves out of a hole, and starts * to follow them, he jumps into another hole and disappears. *
Mutt flinches, whirling around to look behind him. * MUTT
Thought I saw somethin’. * INDY *
You’re jumping at shadows. * They’ve reached a cliff. Mutt drops his shovel into the opening, *
and gets on a ladder. * MUTT *
This way down. * As he is about to take a step down, the ladder disintegrates and *
he falls flat on his back. * Indy looks at him for a beat, then he starts to climb down the *
steps. * He reaches Mutt, and extends his hand. *
INDY * This way up. *
Mutt takes his hand and gets up. *
52. SLAM! *
IndyandMuttareknockedtothegroundbyASHADOWthatdropsout * of the tree branches above. NITO kicks Indy down. Indy hits the * wall and falls down a set of steps to a lower ground. Nito POUNDS Mutt, and immediately disappears back into a hole.
Mutt falls backwards, and suddenly the lone skeleton, (ERNIE) * comes out of the hole from behind and pounces on him! *
Weseeit’sareal,livinghumanbeing,dressedinasuitofbones * to disguise itself.
Mutt whirls the figure around, they struggle. *
Indy reacts and gets up, he grabs the shovel and runs to Mutt. * Mutt ducks at the last moment, Indy hits the creature with the * shovel. *
The bones SHATTER, revealing a human face behind. Before Indy can hit again, the figure slips away under Indy’s *
legs and trips him. He runs into another hole. *
Mutt gets the shovel and CLICKS open his switchblade, he starts * to go after the figure into the hole. He hears something and * turns... *
NITO (the 2nd warrior)comes out of the hole with a blowdart gun, * he raises it and aims at Mutt.. *
THWACK! * A BLOWDART hits Mutt’s shovel handle. Mutt looks at it. Nito is *
about to fire again. * Mutt takes his knife flips it in his hand and hurls it-- *
-- and it grazes the Warrior’s shoulder, drawing blood, and * throwing off his aim. The Warrior drops the blowgun, and takes * the knife out from his wound. He starts to stand and cocks his * arm to hurl it a Mutt, but -- *
--KUH-RACK! *
Indy’s got his whip out. The lash wraps around Nito’s wrist and * wrenches the knife free. It THUMPS to the dirt, Nito jumps down * and runs into the same hole that Ernie went in. Indy sees that * Mutt is alright and follows Nito into the hole. *
Mutt looks around frantically. He hits the skeleton next to him, * still searches for anyone coming, suddenly he senses something * and slowly turns to see: *
53. Ernie comes out from one of the arches carrying the blowdart *
gun. He gets ready to shoot at Mutt. * --Mutt winces, he’s toast for sure-- * -- but suddenly A HAND closes over the barrel of the blowgun -- -- INDY’S HAND! --
-- and he yanks the gun toward himself and BLOWS SAVAGELY into the wrong end of the barrel.
The Warrior GASPS, his eyes go wide as the poison dart flies back up the tube, JABS into the back of his throat, and kills him. *
Suddenly behind Mutt another WARRIOR, holding a bone, lunges * toward him. Mutt is about ready to start the fight. *
-- Indy pulls his revolver, COCKS it -- * -- and the Warrior changes his mind, scurrying up and out of the
grave and disappearing into the darkness.
Mutt has been watching with wide eyes. He looks up and sees Indy * standing there, whip in one hand, gun in the other, LIGHTNING and THUNDER CRACKING behind him.
MUTT You’re a teacher? *
INDY Part-time. *
He UNCOCKS his gun. * Mutt picks up his switchblade. He notices there’s a smear of *
blood on the blade. * MUTT
I never really used it before. * INDY
You did good kid. *
Indy strips the hat and burial serape from one of the skeletons, * wraps the poncho around the dead warrior that just attacked them, and shoves the hat down on his head. Sitting up against the wall of the gave, he looks exactly like the other corpses.
54.
INDY (cont’d) That oughta keep him for a couple hundred
years.
Indy sees a lantern *
Indy and Mutt head down deeper into the cemetery. Mutt is * carrying the lantern. *
MUTT Who were those things?
INDY Nazca Indians. *

INDY * Put that thing away. Give me some light * over here. (bring it over here) *
Mutt moves closer to Indy. *
Indy looks down, sees a couple sets of dusty footprints leading to and from the wall. One of the niches in the wall has a skull wedged in, and as Indy bends down for a closer look, he sees the cobwebs in the skull’s nose and mouth are moving. *
As if the skull is breathing -- or blown by circulating air. Indy’s face lights up. He pulls the skull out by the eye sockets, and sees a looped rope inside the niche.
He pulls on the rope and the rocks CREAK open, revealing a narrow passageway.
Excited, Mutt lunges backwards -- *
And lands next to one of the skeletons, his arm on top the chest. *
-- and a dozen SCORPIONS stream out over his arms.
The biggest one raises its stinger and sinks it into Mutt’s * right hand. *
GAAAAH!
MUTT
Indy starts to go through the opening. Mutt is jumping around , * brushing himself, frantic, trying to get the scorpions away * from him. *
INDY Oh, good.
GOOD?!
MUTT
54B.
INDY Dance on our own dime, will ya. *
MUTT Scorpions! One of ‘em bit me! I’m gonna * die! *
INDY How big? *
Huge!
MUTT
INDY (turns back) When it comes to scorpions, * the bigger the better.
(another thought) * A small one bites you, don’t keep it to * yourself.
And he’s gone, into the tunnel. MUTT *
I’ll keep it to myself. * INDY *
C’mon. * Mutt follows. * CUT TO: * *
55.
61 INT TUNNEL NIGHT *
Indy starts to go down a set of stairs, Mutt follows. *
He gets startled -- he is facing a skeleton, buried upright in * recess in the tunnel walls, their arms and legs bound across * their chests, their dead eyes staring at him. *
Indy, who was ahead, turns back * INDY *
They’re not going to bite you. Let’s go. *
They continue down the stairs, Mutt looks at the skeletons. They * reach the bottom, Mutt walks up to one of them, holding up the * lantern up to the head. *
MUTT * Their SKULLS! Look at their skulls man! *
Indy comes up next to him, he shines the flashlight on the head. * The skull is bizarre. The back of the cranium is elongated, egg- *
shaped. *
INDY * Like the drawings in Oxley’s cell. It * means we’re getting closer. *
MUTT * it’s crazy. Why’s it like that?
INDY * Nazca Indiana used to bind their infants * head with rope to elongate their skull * like that. *
MUTT * Why? *
INDY * Honor the gods. *
Indy moves towards another opening. *
MUTT * No, no. God’s head is not like that, * man. *
INDY * Depends on who your god is. *
Indy enters the opening *
55A. INT. TUNNEL/MAYAN CALENDAR-DISC-NIGHT *
Indy enters the opening he crawls onto a large Mayan Calendar, he * moves across. *
INDY * Calendar, typical early Mayan. *
As he does the disc begins to tilt up covering Mutt’s view on the * other end. Mutt is still holding onto the lantern in his left *
hand.
*
MUTT * This is(You’re) going nowhere fast. * Don’t you think we should go the other * way. Professor aren’t we suppose to be * looking for an exit. This is really a * dead end. *
Indy reacts to the disc moving. He moves closer and looks out at * the other opening. Indy, goes back to Mutt. The disc tilts down * as he approaches Mutt opening the view. *
INDY * That’s it, c’mon genius. *
Indy starts to head back. * INDY (cont’d) *
Bring the backpack, c’mon. * Mutt starts to follow Indy. *
MUTT * Where are we going? *
55B. INT. TUNNEL CRAWL SPACE-NIGHT *
Indy throws his backpack into the crawl space. He slides in, * still carrying his flashlight. Mutt races to catch up to Indy in * the narrow space. But as he scrambles forward on his hands an knees, the floor buckles and his right hand, falls deep into a * hole. *
He claws for a grip on the sides of the floor, he gets back up * onto the firm ground. *
Indy hurries back. * INDY *
You alright? * Mutt nods. *
INDY (cont’d) * The earth’s (grounds) eroded out from * underneath us. We’re on a promontory. *
Mutt, safe for the moment, catches his breath. * MUTT
That’s good to know. * INDY *
Be careful. * And he’s gone again, crawling away into the tunnel, with his *
backpack. * MUTT *
Be careful.(under his breath) * He starts to follow Indy. * Indy is staring out to the opening. Mutt comes up right next to *
him. Indy stops him.
Hold it. They listen, then move out.
*
INDY * *
* *
56.
62 INT UNDERGROUND CHAMBER NIGHT
Indy clears away the cobwebs and heads in... *
The lantern light emerges form the darkness into an underground * burial chamber. *
Indy comes out and looks around in awe. Mutt comes out of the * tunnel behind him. *
INDY * This is incredible. *
MUTT * Unreal. *
Mutt starts to move forward, Indy puts out an arm to stop him * from trampling the place.
INDY * Don’t touch anything. *
He waves the flashlight, exposing two sets of footprints in the * dust. The footprints lead down the stairs and back out again. * Indy and Mutt squat to get a closer look. *
INDY (cont’d) Somebody’s been here. Recently. *
(studying the prints) Two sets. *
Mutt looks at the tracks, measure them with his hand.
MUTT Same size. Could have been the same
person, twice.
INDY (impressed)
Not bad, kid.
Indy walks down the stairs, trying to walk in the existing * footprints. They lead to an object the size of a corpse, wrapped * in a strange, material. Indy starts to count them. *
* * *
57.
INDY (cont’d) * One...two...(turns and walks across the * room)three (at a bottom one-lifts the * flashlight up to) four... five... six... *
seven. (gestures with the flashlight) *
Orellana and his men. Might have made it * out of the jungle after all. *
Indy moves to one of the bodies and tries to open the material * in which it’s wrapped. He tugs at it -- he puts his flashlight * away. *
INDY * Got a knife? *
Mutt takes out his knife and flips it in his hand. He hands it to * Indy. *
INDY (cont’d) * Give me the light. *
Indy starts to cut the body. He pulls the wrapping back, finds * another layer underneath, and pulls that back too. Indy reveals * the body of a SPANISH CONQUISTADOR, five hundred years old --
-- and perfectly preserved. MUTT
It looks like he died yesterday. Indeed it does -- his body is intact, his clothes, his weapons,
even his skin.
INDY It’s the wrappings, they’ve preserved * him.
The face begins to withered away to DUST! It shrivels and rots, * and within ten seconds it’s a pile of dust. *
Indy and Mutt are amazed. * MUTT *
What just happened? *
INDY * It’s been wrapped up for 500 years. Air * doesn’t agree with him. *
*
57A.
Indy reaches inside the body. *
He pulls free a solid gold dagger with a jewel encrusted handle * and holds it up to the lantern light, admiring it. Indy hands * Mutt his switchblade back. *
Indy starts to put the dagger in his satchel but-- * MUTT *
Hey! *
INDY * I was going to put it back. I don’t want * to keep borrowing yours all the time. *
MUTT
Uh huh. Indy returns the dagger -- * Mutt moves to the other side of the crypt. *
MUTT (cont’d) * is this one open already? *
Indy joins Mutt. The cocoon is torn open. * There is a golden mask over the face of this corpse. *
INDY * It’s him! It’s Orellana himself. *
*
*
58. Indy gestures to the skeleton, festooned with gilded armor. *
INDY (cont’d) * they called him, the gilded Man. What an * incredible find. *
He stops himself, furrows his brow. Something’s not right. He * points to the mask over Orellana’s face. *
Indy reaches out to the mask, runs his hand along the edges. *
He closes his fingers around the mask and pulls it away slowly, * revealing the skull of Orellana himself, contorted in a horrible *
death shriek.
INDY (cont’d) His lust for gold was legendary. This is
odd..
Indy crosses to the other side of Orellana, and squats by side. He picks some gold coins off the floor, studies the impressions.
INDY (cont’d) Somebody already has been here and gone.
Left all this gold and (all)these artifacts. What were they looking (Indy starts to get up)
The coins are pulled by a magnetic force. They get stuck Orellana’s body.

INDY (cont’d)
Indy goes to the body, reaches down and lifts Orellana’s and torso. He hands it to Mutt.
INDY (cont’d)
Hold this. Mutt is eye to eye with the screaming, dead face.
Indy looks beneath where the corpse was lying. He reaches and carefully lifts the a skull away from the corpse.
MUTT puts the skeleton down.
59. ---- THE CRYSTAL SKULL OF AKATOR. *
Stunning. It was, indeed, cut form one piece of pure crystal, * and is completely transparent, yet multi-faceted. . *
Indy holds the Crystal Skull up to the lantern. The light prisms * through it, especially the eyes -- they’re lensed, the light * focusing through the sockets in a penetrating gaze. There * appears to be a second crystal, embedded in the brain cavity, * opal in color, standing out against the skull’s bluish tint. *
INDY (cont’d) * Unbelievable. No tool marks... A single * piece of seamless quartz. *
A coin gets stuck to the skull. Indy removes it. *
INDY (cont’d) * Cut across the grain, no evidence of a * lapidary wheel. It’s not possible, even * with today’s technology. It would * shatter. What is this thing? *
As Indy turns the skull, Mutt’s eyes widen in surprise, because * the back of the skull’s head is egg-shaped, like the corpses * outside. *
MUTT * Look at he shape of the head. Maybe to * the Nazca Indians...this was their god. * Is this the one from... *
INDY * Akator. (Indy begins to pace)Maybe the * Spaniards find the skull along with all * this other booty. They head to their * ships along the coast. Maybe the Indians * catch up with them, where they get to * squabbling amongst themselves. The * Indians wrap ’em up and buried them here. *
*
59A.
Indy looks at the skull, then down at the footprints again, thinking aloud, piecing it together. *
INDY (cont’d) * Couple(500 centuries) hundred years * later Oxley shows up, finds the skull, * takes it away, maybe to Akator. Then he * returns it here. *
MUTT * “Return, return.” Like he wrote on the * walls of his cell. *
INDY * He put it back where he found it. Why?
Mutt’s switchblade flies out of his hand and CLINKS up against * the skull, pulled by the metal’s magnetic force. *
INDY (cont’d) * Crystal is not magnetic. *
MUTT Neither is gold. *
Indy looks back at the skull, staring deeply into its eyes. INDY *
What is this thing? He gazes deeper, and deeper, and the skull seems to glow in
response, or is it just reflecting light from the lantern?
Indy’s eyes grow wider, he’s transfixed, and it doesn’t seem he could possibly tear his eyes away from the thing.
Even Mutt has noticed the hypnotic quality of the skull, and he steps forward to look at it, now right behind Indy --
-- and the floor beneath them gives way! Mutt falls, but grabs hold of the leg of Orellana’s skeleton as *
he goes down, through the floor -- * *

IQUITOS NIGHT
62.
10/15/07
Night has fallen on the outskirts of the jungle city of Iquitos, the last toehold of civilization before the Amazon. A SOVIET ARMY REGIMENT is amassed in a makeshift camp on the edge of the clawing jungle.
There are a dozen vehicles -- jeeps, trucks, one great big machine with a series of horizontal saw blades on the front, and FIFTY RED ARMY SOLDIERS.
The Russians are a celebratory bunch, some of them grouped around a bonfire where a CRAZY RUSSIAN dances wildly.
A small tent glows at the center of the camp, lit up by the lantern-light within. There are TWO GUARDS at the flap.
69 INT TENT NIGHT
Inside the tent, Indy is sitting in a chair to which he has been * tied. Dovchenko is watching the tent. *
Amnesia darts?
INDY *
63.
Mac enters, holding a bottle of liquor in one hand and a cigar * in the other. He walks up to Indy, smiling his most winning * smile.
MUTT * You’re lucky I turned up Jonesey. * Dovchenko wanted to blow your brains out * That’s the three times I’ve saved your * life, mate. *
INDY Unshackle me and I’ll give you a big * hug. *
MAC You had a Luger pointed at the base of
your skull when we first met. * INDY *
I had the situation under control. *
MAC * Do you remember the amnesia darts I * pulled out of your neck in Jakarta?
MAC See, you don’t remember! Take my word
for it, you owe me. Mac sits down, where a reel-to-reel tape recorder is turning on a *
table, recording every word. *
INDY * What about them? What do you owe them? * After the war, when you turned -- how * many names did you give the Reds? How * many good men died because of you? *
MAC * I don’t think you see the big picture, * mate. *
INDY * Eventually they’re going to let me out of * this chair, comrade, and when they do I’m * going to (bust)break your nose. *
Mac puts the bottle down and picks up the microphone. *
63A.
MAC “Comrade?” You think this is about * flags? This is about uniforms? It’s * about lines on a map? *
INDY it’s just about money, isn’t it? *
64.
MAC No, not “only money,” (he drops the * microphone gets up and goes to Indy))a * gigantic pile of money! Don’t worry * about what the Russians will pay us, * it’s nothing compared to what’s at Akator. An entire city of gold, it’s * what the Conquistadors were after * (looking, searching), for Dog’s sake * Jonesey! We could be richer, richer * than Howard Hughes.
INDY * Blood money. Every nickle of it. *
Mac leans in and lowers his voice. It’s stilted, as if Mac’s * trying to tell Indy something.
MAC * I need you to see the angle here, mate, * to be smart and do the right thing. Like * in- *
Before he can finish, the lantern light flickers as someone pushes open the tent flap, letting in a breeze from outside. A shadow falls across them both.
Indy looks up. Irina Spalko stands behind Mac, dressed in Russian military fatigues. *
Mac doesn’t need to turn around, he knows perfectly well who it is. He finishes what he was saying to Indy, voice low --
MAC (cont’d) Like in Berlin. Get me? Just like * Berlin. *
Mac heads out and walks past Spalko and Dovchenko. *
MAC (cont’d) * You want me to jiggle out of here, or * should I sing a song. Paddling Madeline. * (he starts to sing) I love this girl * called Madeline. I know she loves me * too, cause every night the moon shines * bright she rides in my canoe at * midnight. *
-- and beats it out of the tent. Spalko sizes up Indy.
64A.
SPALKO How fortunate our failure to kill you,
Dr. Jones. You survive to be of service to us once again. *
She walks towards the recorder * INDY
You know me, anything I can do to help.
SPALKO
“Now I am become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds.” You recognize those words? It was your own Dr. Oppenheimer, after he created the atomic bomb.
She turns off one of the switches and continues to move around * Indy. *
INDY He was quoting the Hindu Bible.
EXT. TENT-NIGHT * Mac steps near the fire still singing his song(Paddling Madeline *
Home) *
MAC * I love this girl called Madelin. I know * she loves me too cause every night the * moon shines bright she rides in my canoe * at midnight. *
He is no longer drunk, he looks back at Indy’s tent. *
65.
SPALKO It was nuclear intimidation. But now
this next level of weapon is ours to have -- yours to fear.
INDY Weapon? What weapon?
Spalko moves to the front and faces Indy, she leans on the chair * with her leg. *
SPALKO A mind weapon. A new frontier of psychic * warfare; that was Stalin’s dream. *
Indy looks at her like she’s nuts.
INDY * Now I know why Oxley put the skull back * where he found it. He knows you were * after it. *
SPALKO * That skull is no mere deity carving. * Surely you knew the moment you laid eyes * on it -- it was not made by human hands.
She leans forward and puts her hands on Indy’s legs. *
INDY Who made it then? *
(off her look) C’mon. *
She looks across the tent and moves. *
SPALKO * that body we found in New Mexico was not * the first. *
Spalko walks across the tent into a side tent. There is a body * covered on a table. She starts to clean her hands with a cloth. *
SPALKO (cont’d) * We’d already dissected two others from * similar crash sites in Soviet Union. *
INDY * Saucer-men from Mars? *
her with a flashlight.
INDY You gotta be kidding
SPALKO Why do you disbelief Do you choose not to

me. *
your own eyes.(Why * believe your own * *
65A.
SPALKO * The legends about Akator are all true. * Early man couldn’t have conceived it, much less built it. It was a city of supreme beings, with technologies and * paranormal abilities. *
She moves to the head of the table, Dovchenko standing next to *
eyes? She uncovers the body and reveals the alien form. Spalko moves *
the head and opens the brain,exposing the crystal skull. *
SPALKO (cont’d) * The New Mexico specimen gave us hope. * Unlike the others we’d found, (this)its * skeleton was pure crystal. A distant * cousin, perhaps? Maybe they too were * sent to find Akator. Perhaps we’re all * searching for the same thing. There’s no * other explanations *
INDY * There’s always another explanation. *
Spalko washes her hands. *
SPALKO * The skull was stolen from Akator in the * 15th century. *
She walks back to Indy’s tent. *
SPALKO (cont’d) * Whoever returns it -- *
65B.
INDY * --to the city’s temple will gain control * over its power. I’ve heard that bedtime * story before. What makes you think * Akator even exists. (But what if Akator * never existed)(It’s a legend why do you * think Akator even existed) *
SPALKO * Perhaps you should ask your friend that * question. *
DOVCHENKO * PRIRIDITYE PROFESSORA!(bring in the * professor) *
SPALKO * We’re certain he’s been there. *
INDY * Oxley. Where is he? *
CUT TO: * *
66. 70 EXT- RUSSIAN CAMP NIGHT *
The Crazy Guy is still dancing around it like a madman. He’s * dressed in an old, battered suit, the arms and legs shredded. His hair is long and wild, and he’s flinging his body around the campfire with mad abandon while the Russians laugh and clap,
mocking him. A couple of he soldiers approach Oxley, grab him and take him to *
the tent. * INT. TENT-NIGHT *
PROFESSOR HAROLD OXLEY looks nothing like the conservative archeology professor we saw in the photo. He’s got wild, red- rimmed eyes, his cheeks are sunken and his clothes hang from his skeletal form. He starts to dance with a musical pole. *
INDY * Ox? Ox! It’s me, Indy. * (ox)You’re faking it, right pal? *
Oxley won’t even look at Indy. His eyes are wild, they never rest, never make eye contact. Oxley dances towards Indy. *
OXLEY
Through eyes that last I saw in tears...
Indy pulls Oxley close, lowers his voice. *
INDY (Ox)Listen to me pal, your name is * Harold Oxley, you were born in Leeds, * England. You and I went to school * together at the University of Chicago, and you were never this interesting! My * name is Indi- *
(though it pains him) * My name is Henry Jones Junior. *
But Oxley just spins away and he’s off again, dancing around him * and, MUTTERING unintelligibly. Indy whirls on Mac and Spalko. *
INDY (cont’d) * What have you done to him?! *
MAC * We ain’t done a thing, it’s the bloody * skull. *
66A.
SPALKO * He is a divining nod that will lead us to * Akator. But we need someone to interpret * him for us. His mind, it seems, is * quite weak. Let’s hope yours is * stronger. *
CUT TO: *
67. 71 INT LARGER TENT NIGHT *
Dovchenko catches Indy’s hat. Spalko moves to a table, Indy’s * backpack is resting on it. *
Spalko opens the backpack and pulls the CRYSTAL SKULL, she takes * it in her arms and walks towards Indy. The lamps all move * towards the skull. *
Indy is in the chair still strapped, he is now wearing a strap * across his head, attached to electrodes to his temples and * frontal lobe. *
SPALKO * The skull’s crystal stimulates an * undeveloped part of the human brain, * opening a psychic channel. *
*
68.
Spalko turns the skull to face Indy. The lensed eye sockets * catch the light and glow intensely. Spalko sits it down facing * Indy.
SPALKO (cont’d) * Oxley lost control of his mind by staring * too long into its eyes. *
Spalko walk to Indy. *
SPALKO (cont’d) * We believe you can get through to him * after yo have done the same. *
She puts a hand on Indy’s cheek, stroking it, trying gently to * turn him toward the skull. *
INDY I got a better idea. You look at it. *
SPALKO * The skull does not speak to everyone, it * seems. *
Spalko walks back to the skull.
SPALKO (cont’d) * Surely you’re not afraid, Dr. Jones? * You’ve spent your entire life searching * for answer, think of the truth behind * those eyes. *
She puts her hands around the skull. * Spalko walks to the side of the tent. *
There is a Scientist seated at a table with a EEG monitor, she * walks up to the table. *
SPALKO (cont’d) * there maybe be hundreds of these skulls * at Akator, perhaps thousands. Whoever * finds them will control the greatest * natural force the world has ever known. * (she picks up a stopwatch-and turns to * Indy) Power over the mind of man. *
INDY * Be careful. You might get exactly what *
you ask for. I usually do.
*
SPALKO * *
68A.
Spalko starts her stopwatch. * Indy smiles. *
A strange pulsing emanates from the center of the skull, brighter * in its eyes. Indy can’t help it, he’s drawn to it -- *
Indy looks deeply into the skull’s eyes. Immediately, the needles * on the EEG graph spike. *
The light in the eyes of the skull grows brighter and Indy’s * stare more intense. The EEG readings increase in density. *
Spalko takes note. *
69.
SPALKO (cont’d) Imagine -- to peer across the world and
know the enemy’s secrets. To place our thoughts in the minds of your leaders -- * (she moves towards Indy)-- make your * teachers teach the true version of history, your soldiers attack on our * orders. *
Indy couldn’t look away from the skull now if he wanted to. * Spalko walks around Indy. *
SPALKO (cont’d) We’ll be everywhere at once, as powerful
as a whisper, invading your dreams, * thinking your thoughts for you while you sleep. *
Spalko walks back to the stand where the skull is. * The veins in Indy’s temples swell; his heartbeat’s visible in *
them. He can’t speak, he’s caught in the gaze of the skull. *
The EEG needle is going batshit now, jumping all over the place, * scribbling a line so dense it’s almost one solid block of ink on * the paper. *
SPALKO (cont’d) * we will change you, Dr. Jones, all of * you, from the inside. We will turn YOU * into US. *
Indy’s face is trembling now, red and flushed, and bright red * capillaries pop out in the whites of his eyes. *
SPALKO (cont’d) * and the best part? You won’t even know * it’s happening. *
Indy still stares into the skull’s eyes, and he starts to mutter now, directly to the skull.
Return.
INDY
69A.
		72  EXT BY THE CAMPFIRE NIGHT  And just as Indy says the word “return,” we cut abruptly out to the campfire, where Oxley is sitting by the campfire, as if * hearing the word from Indy’s lips, but of course he’s too far away. But he repeats it:  OXLEY  Return.

Back in the tent, the veins in Indy’s temples throb. Mac steps forward. *
MAC That’s enough! For God’s sake if he * dies we can’t get there! *
Just when it seems Indy can’t take anymore -- SPALKO
Cover it. *
She stops the stopwatch. *
Dovchenko darts in and pull a hood over the skull, breaking * Indy’s gaze. Mac gets close to Indy and study his blank * expression.
MAC Jonesey, you alright? *
Indy looks up at him. His eyes focus and he shakes his head, his * mind clearing.
Mac unties Indy’s arm. The second Indy’s arm is free -- * -- HE PUNCHES MAC IN THE FACE.
MAC (cont’d) * You broke my nose!
INDY I Told you. *
Indy takes off the head gear, Dovchenko grabs Indy and pulls him * away. Spalko steps up to him, eye to eye.
SPALKO Enough. You will speak to Oxley and
lead us to Akator. Yes?
INDY Expecting that response, she immediately BARKS an order. *
SPALKO * Take him outside. *
Nyet.
Two soldiers leapt to attention and -- *
71. 76 EXT RUSSIAN CAMP NIGHT *
Spalko comes out of the tent, followed by Dovchenko ,and Indy-- * Dovchenko throws Indy his hat.. they drag Mutt out of a nearby * tent. They shove him roughly up alongside Indy. *
INDY You alright, kid? *
MUTT They left my bike in that cemetery!
INDY (you don’t understand)
Yeah but are you alright? *
MUTT (you don’t understand)
They left my bike!
One of the Russian Soldiers holds a polished cherry wood case, two feet wide, four feet long, with a molded velvet interior. In * the case there are several sabers and foils. *
She selects a wicked-looking one and approaches Mutt with it, clearly a threat.
MUTT (cont’d) Wait! Don’t! Stop! *
Geez, the kid panics easily. But Mutt fools us -- he pulls his comb from his back pocket and runs it through his hair, gets it just right. And then, to Spalko, utterly fearless:
MUTT (cont’d) I’m ready. *
(to Indy) don’t give these pigs a thing.
Indy smiles. Gotta love the kid’s attitude. He looks back at Spalko defiantly.
INDY You heard him.
SPALKO Clearly, I have chosen the wrong pressure
point.
71A.
SPALKO (cont’d) Perhaps I can find a more sensitive one.
(to two Soldiers)
Privedite zhenshchinu!(bring in the * woman) *

nearby tent. We hear her VOICE before we see her. *
VOICE (O.S.) Get your hands off me, you rotten
Russkie son of a bitch- * Indy’s eyes widen, he recognizes that voice, and the soldiers
reappear, dragging their struggling captive along with them.
She’s in her late forties, she’s a knockout, and she’s smarter than you. She used to be the girl next door you had a crush on; now she’s the woman next door you’ve always been in love with.
She’s MARION RAVENWOOD. Marion!
INDY MARION
Indiana Jones. ‘Bout time you showed up. * Indy walks to Marion. *

INDY Yeah, I know I just, I never thought * that - *
MARION That I have a life after you left? *
INDY That’s not what I meant- *
MARION A damn good life. *
INDY Well That’s good(nice)(I’m glad), I just- *
MARION A damn good life.(a damn good really * good damn life)(a damn good, great, good * life) *
INDY So have I. *
MARION Yeah? Still leaving a trail of human * wreckage, or have you retired? *
INDY Why, are you looking for a date? *
MARION * With anyone(anybody) but you. *
INDY * What are you mad at me for? (why are you * so mad at me? ) *
MARION * How much time have you got? *
Spalko joins them. * * *
74.
SPALKO * So, Dr. Jones. You will help us? A * simple yes will do.
INDY Aw, Marion. You had to go and get
yourself kidnapped.
MARION Not like you did any better.
INDY Same old same old.
Indy notices Mac is staring at Marion approvingly. * INDY (cont’d) *
What are you looking at? * CUT TO:
77 EXT BY THE CAMPFIRE NIGHT
Harold Oxley sits, staring off into the distance intently. *
Mac is standing nearby, he turns to the Russians with him he e * lowers his voice. *
MAC I’m giving three to one the Yank figures
him out. Who wants some. * The Russian nods, takes the bet. Mac takes money out of his *
pocket. *
Indy sits across from Oxley, who’s staring at him openly now, his * entire face lit up in a smile, as if he’s seeing Indy for the first time.
OXLEY Henry Jones Junior! Henry Jones Junior! *
Indy looks at him, amazed. It worked. Spalko presses forward to hear, she is right next to Indy. *
INDY That’s right, Ox. That’s right, Ox. Now * listen to me- *
*
74A.
He grabs Indy, intently, trying to communicate something.
75.
OXLEY * “To lay their just hands on that Golden
Key... That ope’s the Palace of Eternity.”
INDY The palace of -- ?
Spalko steps in. It’s from Milton, he’s said it before. *
SPALKO Why? *
Indy has no idea. He looks back at Oxley, notices his right hand is tremoring, as if with palsy.
INDY ox. I you gotta tell us how to get to
Akator, or they're going to kill Marion. *
OXLEY
“Through eyes that last I saw in tears... here in death’s dream kingdom...”
Indy reaches out to still Oxley’s twitching right hand.
INDY Harold they’re gonna kill Abner’s little * girl,! You remember Abner, don’t you? *
Oxley urgency grows, he’s trying to get through but can’t. OXLEY
“eyes! That last I saw in- tears-” *
INDY (getting frustrated)
You gotta tell us how we get there(to * Akator) I need specifics. *
Indy notices Oxley’s right hand is moving faster now, detailed motions not just tremors. And his fingers are pinched together, as if holding something.
INDY (CONT’D) (to the Russians)
Yeah, get me paper and something to * write with.! *
MAC * Get some paper. *
Paper... A MOMENT LATER,
MUTT * *
75A.
time.
76.
A notebook is hurriedly passed to Indy, who flips it open to a blank page. He takes Oxley’s right hand and clamps the pen between his friend’s fingers, then shoves the paper under it.
And Oxley starts writing. He’s drawing something, a picture, and * it’s detailed. *
SPALKO * He’s auto-writing. Of course, I should * have seen this. *
OXLEY (still staring at Indy)
Henry Jones Junior! * But he’s not looking at the paper, he’s staring at Indy the whole
INDY * That’s right Ox. *
OXLEY * (confidentially, to Indy)
three times it drops. INDY *
Three times. *
Indy looks at the page. Oxley’s drawn a crude sketch of ocean waves. Oxley’s writing continues -- this time it’s a pair of * closed eyes.
Spalko and the others press in closely, to take a look. Spalko looks at Indy admiringly. *
Oxley's not slowing down. Three more sketches -- the sun with an * arc across a sky, a snake with a flicking tongue, and what looks like a horizon.
SPALKO * Pictographs? *
INDY Ideograms! Keep going Ox.
Indy takes the book from Oxley, stands and walks to the fire pit, * Spalko joins him. *
76A. Mutt comes forward to Oxley, he sits across from him. He tries to *
look him in the eye. * MUTT *
Ox? *
But Oxley won’t look at hi, might not even be aware that he’s * there. Certainly doesn’t recognize him, his eyes darting all over * the place. *
MUTT (cont’d) * C’mon, Ox, it’s me. It’s Mutt. *
But Oxley won’t. Or can’t. There are tears in Mutt’s eyes. * MUTT (cont’d) *
Please? * Indy looks at the sketches, decoding them as he speaks * *
77.
INDY * I think I got it. The wavy lines, means * of course water, a closed eye means * sleep -- the sun with the arc over the * sky stands for “time,” duration, the * word now is “until.” The horizon and * the snake they’re close together, means * one thought (the horizon and the snake * means one thought, they’re close * together) -- the horizon (stood for)was * the world, but it didn’t mean the earth, it meant big, “great.”
Indy thinks like crazy, looking at the page back and forth. *
INDY (cont’d) “the water sleeps, until the Great
Snake.” These aren’t just drawings, they’re directions.
(to a Russian) Give me a map! *
Spalko gives the order in Russian. * 78 MOMENTS LATER
A table is brought out and a map of the Amazon is unfurled. As * Indy bends over the map, Mac collects a wad of cash from the Russian Soldier he made the bet with.
INDY (O.S.) The Great snake is the Amazon,of course * but “sleeps,” what river sleeps?
Indy studies the map for a name, a clue, something, then stops suddenly and jabs his finger down.
SPALKO * Here. The Sono. The Portuguese word
for sleep. Everyone bends down to see, and Mac presses in close beside
Marion. * Indy bends over the map, fascinated now.
INDY Yes! Good, exactly, very good! *
* *
78. Mutt watches Indy and Spalko studying the map together. *
INDY (cont’d) * He wants us to follow this curve of the * Sono down to where it meets the Amazon, * on the southeast. After that, I’m not * sure. a dream kingdom, eyes in tears -- * I have no idea know what he means. *
Mutt, who’s been peering slides further forward, as Indy studies * the map.
INDY (cont’d) But his route could be right, it’s a
completely unexplored part of the canopy. Spalko bends down closer to the map --
INDY (cont’d) See, the mapmaker only sketched in a few
rough lines- * -- AND MUTT Punches one of the soldiers and OVERTURNS THE TABLE. *
It hits Spalko in the face, knocking her and Dovchenko back on their asses.
MUTT Mutt heads towards the tent. Indy has no choice but to follow *
Marion, Oxley and Indy all go into the tent. *
The group runs away, Mutt comes back and grabs one of the lamps * and throws it on the ground. A fire starts, stopping Spalko and * the solders from coming through. *
*
RUN!
78A. 10/16/07
79 EXT JUNGLE DAWN Mutt, Marion, Indy, and Oxley race through the jungle as the sun
rises, the foliage slapping and cutting at them.
INDY KID? WHAT THE HELL ARE WE DOING, KID?!
MUTT They were gonna kill us!
INDY Well, maybe!
MUTT Somebody had to do something!
INDY Something else would have been good!
MUTT At least I got a plan! Let’s go!
*
Stop!
INDY MARION Keep back!
Mom?
79. 10/16/07
INDY This is intolerable!
Oxley’s looking back over his shoulder, trying to watch the skull as he moves further away from it, reaching out for it.
INDY (cont’d) Harold, for God’s sake, keep up!
Mutt turns sharply and leads them down a narrow ravine, through a thick copse of trees, and into a tiny clearing.
They stand there, safe for a moment, trying not to make a sound as the Russian Soldiers race past them, deeper into the jungle.
Mutt and Oxley stand at the edge of the trees, peering through, and Indy and Marion are behind them.
MUTT Shhh!-- *
He stops. Indy and Marion are gone.
Actually, they’re not gone, they’re just two feet lower than they were the last time he saw them.
And they’re up to their knees in sand.
MUTT (cont’d) He takes a step forward, but --
Mutt stops where he is, confused. And Indy and Marion sink even lower, now up to their thighs.
INDY Don’t move, honey! Moving makes space, * space will make you sink! *
MARION (pulling hard at her leg)
I think I can get -- out if --
INDY STOP IT! You’re pulling against a
vacuum, it’s like trying to lift a car! Just stay calm!
KA-PHOOM!!
80.
10/16/07
MARION Okay, I’m calm.
(sinking)
MUTT What is it, quicksand?!
INDY (there’s always time to teach)
It’s a dry sandpit.
MARION I’m calm. I’m sinking, but I’m calm.
*
*
* *
INDY Quicksand is a viscous mix of mud, clay, * and water,(sand, clay and water) and * depending of the fluidity it’s not as * dangerous as you might-
MARION * (thrashing again)
JONES FOR PETE’S SAKE, WE’RE NOT IN SCHOOL!
INDY you’re right! Stay calm! There’s nothing * to worry about, unless there’s a-
A huge geyser of sand suddenly spits up between them, ten feet into the air, and in the resulting settling of the pit, Indy and Marion sink all the way up to their chests.
Void collapse.
INDY (cont’d)
MUTT I’ll get something to pull you out!
INDY * Keep your arms up high. *
He looks around, can’t find anything handy, and moves off into the jungle, frantic. But Oxley only stares at them, bemused.
*
* *
help!
“Help.” Help. Help. Help Help. Yes, go. Help.
OXLEY INDY OXLEY INDY OXLEY INDY OXLEY

And without another word, he turns and walks away. Indy and Marion are alone, up to their chests in sand. Marion looks at him, feeling responsible.
MARION Mutt can be a little impetuous.
KA-PHOOM!
81. 10/16/07
INDY Not the worst quality in the wor-
Another geyser of sand erupts between them, and they drop further, up to their necks now. Their arms are starting to slip beneath the surface of the sand, and they try valiantly to keep them up. But they’re dropping deeper by the second.
They speak, but the constriction from the sandpit pressing in on their chests makes it hard to find breath.
INDY (cont’d) ... keep you ... arms above surface...
the kid comes back, grab on... Marion turns and looks at him, her eyes filling with tenderness.
MARION ... Indy, his...
INDY ... he’s a good kid, Marion... you * should get off his back about school...
MARION ... Mutt, I mean...
INDY ... not everybody’s... cut out for it...
MARION ... his... his name is Henry.
And even through he’s up to his neck in a deadly dray sandpit, Indy * manages to turn his head to Marion and look into her eyes.
INDY Henry? Good name. *
*
He’s your son. My son? Henry Jones, the third.
MARION INDY MARION
Indy looks away, thinking, all the repercussions sinking in -- and then he turns back to Marion furious
82. 10/16/07
INDY Why the HELL didn’t you make him finish
school?!
Before she can answer, something long and heavy comes WHIZZING through the air and SMACKS into the sand between them.
Mutt stands at the edge of the pit, holding the other end of whatever it is, but it’s dark and we can’t tell.
MUTT MOM! GRAB ON! *
Marion, who is slightly ahead of Indy, throws her arms over the think, roundish shape.
Indy, slightly deeper in the sand, wrenches his arms free and reaches for the end of the thing --
-- when it turns and HISSES at him. The “thing” is very long, very thick SNAKE.
INDY Are you crazy?!
MARION Just grab on, Indy!
INDY It’s a SNAKE!
MUTT It’s a rat snake! *
INDY Rat snakes aren’t that big!
MUTT Well, this one is! It’s not poisonous! * Now just grab on! *
INDY Go get something else!
MUTT LIKE WHAT?!
INDY some rope or something!
MUTT THERE’S NO SEARS AND ROEBUCK HERE, JUST * GRAB A HOLD!
83.
10/16/07
INDY Maybe I can touch the bottom!
MARION There is no bottom, now grab it!
INDY I think I can feel it with my feet!
MUTT Grab the snake
INDY Stop calling it that!
MUTT What do you want me to call it? It’s a
snake, grab it!
INDY Say rope!
* *
* *
* * *
* *
* *
* *
*
* *
What?
MUTT
INDY Say grab the rope!!!
They look at each other.
MARION & MUTT Grab the rope!!!
finally, Indy relents, reaches out, closes his eyes, and grabs hold of the snake, just as --
-- KA-PHOOM!!
The biggest sand geyser of all erupts in the pit, and in the momentary space created around them, Mutt pulls as hard as he can on the other end of the black snake.
Indy and Marion are released from the pit and go flying to its edge, collapsing in a heap on top of Mutt, arms and legs entangled.
Get rid
You are snakes!
* INDY *
of that, son. *
MUTT * one crazy old man. Afraid of * *
83A. 10/16/07 TWO PAIRS OF BLACK BOOTS step into frame. Harold Oxley is *
standing between Spalko, Mac, and two Russian Soldiers.
MAC (sadly)
Why do you wanna do everything the hard way, Jonesy? *
But Oxley’s proud. * INDY
Nice, work Ox. thanks. * OXLEY *

		82  IN THE BACK OF THE TRUCK, The Crystal Skull is now in a burlap bag, cinched at the top. *  Irina Spalko opens the bag and pulls it down, revealing the eyes * of the skull. She bends down in front of it and focuses her bright blue eyes on its crystal sockets.  But it has no reaction. No glow. No nothing.  Oxley, sitting in the back of the truck, muttering to himself, * watching the light dance through the trees.  She turns back to the skull, desperate. Why him and not me? She lays her hands on either side of its face, leans even closer. but nothing.  Oxley tries to reach for the skull, Spalko raises her hand to * stop him. *  MAC (O.S.) Skull’s go a mind of its own, eh?  Spalko turns, startled. Mac is grinning. * MAC (cont’d)  Very choosy about who it talks to. * Spalko cinches the bag shut. * 
		83  IN THE FRONT, * 
85.
MAC A lot of old cockswalop. People stare * into that thing, work themselves up in a * frenzy -- self-hypnosis, maybe something * like that, ESP? I don’t think so. *
SPALKO Telepathy already exists in man, in a * lesser developed form.
MAC are you kidding? You think everybody is * psychic? *
SPALKO You’re a gambler. Have you never played
a hung that proved correct? *
MAC * It’s just luck. I should now mine’s * usually bad. *
She turns to face Mac. *
SPALKO * We sent a submarine under the surface * with a mother rabbit’s new litter on * board. She remained on shore while one by * one, the young rabbits were exterminated. *
MAC * Lady, you need a new hobby. *
SPALKO * (ignoring that) Miles away, the mother’s * EEG readings showed reaction at the very * instant of death. There is without a * question an organic mind-body link shared * by all living creatures; we must control * that collective link-- *
She turns back. *
MAC * alright, (he touches her shoulder)then * you show me. I bet you double or nothing * on my fee- *
(looks into her eyes) -- what am I thinking right now?
He’s leering.
85A.
SPALKO Much too easy.
MAC Besides that. C’mon, amuse me. I’m * thinking of a question. What’s the answer?
Spalko turns, raises her hand and looks him in the eye. He looks * back at her, his usual leer at first, but as the stare goes on, it fades.
Spalko’s eyes are intense, hypnotic. Beautiful eyes, but so cold they’re nearly white. Impossible to look away from.
Finally, after a long moment; *
SPALKO The answer to your question is, “If I
feel the slightest need.”
She makes a movement with her hand under his neck, like a sword * cutting his throat. Mac looks truly frightened, he sits back, * silent.
Spalko turns around again, looking out the windshield. Oxley, * who’s been following the conversation, looks back at Mac, wondering what the hell he asked. But Mac is rattled, in a way we haven’t seen before. *
Suddenly, a voice BOOMS over the jungle:
MUTT (O.S.) YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME!!!
86. 84 EXT/INT TRUCK DAY
Indy is in the back of the rear vehicle, hands tied behind his back, as are Mutt and Marion. They bounce through the jungle, guarded by the scowling Dovchenko. There are crates with Cyrillic lettering piled all around them.
MARION Damn it! Damn it! Damn it! I don’t know
how to say this. ( I didn’t want to tell you) (I am just going to say it) Indy’s first name is Henry just like yours(Colin wasn’t your father-ng line for the rest of the dialogue -indy’s response)Indy’s your father
MUTT WHAT? YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME!!!RIGHT?
Mutt is outraged with Marion; he’s just been told the news.
MUTT (cont’d) No, no, he was British, he was an RAF
pilot, my dad was a war hero, not some school teacher!
MARION No, sweetie. Colin was your step-
father.(step-dad) We started dating when you were three months old. He was a good man, but he wasn’t your father.
INDY Wait a minute, “Colin,” as in Colin
Williams? You married him? I introduced you!
Dovchenko rolls his eyes -- he doesn’t understand all of what they’re saying, but he knows he’s sick of hearing it.
MARION I think you gave up your vote on who I
marry when you decide to break it off a week before our wedding.
INDY It wasn’t going to work, Marion, we both
knew that. (or) We both knew that it wasn’t going to work, Marion.
87.
MARION You didn’t know that, why didn’t you just
talk to me? (or) why didn’t you just try talking to me?
INDY Because we(or) I never had an argument
that I won.
MARION Ha! It’s not my fault if you can’t keep
up.
INDY I didn’t want to hurt you.
MARION You failed. Didn’t you ever wonder years
ago why Ox stopped talking to you?(years ago) He hated that you ran away.
MUTT Stop. Would you two stop ?
INDY Yeah, Marion, let’s not make the kid
listen to Mom and Dad fight.(or) let’s not have the kid hear mom and Dad fight.(or) Let’s not let him see Mom and Dad fight.
DOVCHENKO For the love of God, shut in hell up!
MUTT You’re not my dad!
INDY You bet I am, and I’ve got news for you,
you’re going to go back and finish school.
Dovchenko’s had it. CURSING A BLUE STREAK in Russian, he BANGS his gun down on the floor and picks up a rag, spins it into a tight line to use as a gag.
MUTT Am I ? What?! What happened to “there’s
not a dam(ng) thing wrong with it and don’t let anybody tell you any different?! speech. You don’t remember that?
INDY That was before I was your father.
MUTT You’re not my father!
MARION Oh yes he is!
Dovchenko enters & puts the gag on*
DOVCHENKO For the love of God, shut the hell up!
INDY You should have told me about the kid,
Marion. I had a right to know. Dovchenko enters & puts the gag on*
MARION You vanished after that.
I wrote.
INDY
87A.
MARION A year later. By then Mutt was born and
I was married.
INDY So why’d you bother telling me now?
Dovchenko enters & puts gag on * MARION
I thought we were gonna die! Dovchenko is bending over Marion, as he finishes with the gag in
Marion’s mouth. The angle gives Indy the perfect opportunity to--
Not yet! --KICK HIM on his back.
INDY
With both feet, no less. Dovchenko falls against the side of the truck, he looses his hat. He sits up and spins around, dazed, and ends up in perfect striking range for Indy, He kicks him in the face.
Indy doesn’t answer.
Oh shit!.
MUTT (cont’d)
88.
Dovchenko spins to Mutt’s side, Mutt lands a kick.
This sends Dovchenko back to Indy again. Indy kicks him again back to Mutt.
Mutt kicks him again towards Indy.
Indy is about to kick him. Dovchenko slumps to the floor, unconscious.
Mutt grins and kicks the switchblade out of his boot, where he’s hidden it. It THUNKS open on the floor of the truck.
Mutt grabs it with his two feet and throws it to Indy.
MUTT You got it?
Finally Indy gets his rope cut, he moves to them to get them free.
89. 10/16/07
85 MOMENTS LATER, Indy removes the gag from Marion’s mouth, then starts to untie *
* her hands. *
Marion looks away from Indy, grumpy. Doesn’t want to ask this, but she can’t help herself:
MARION I’m sure I wasn’t the only one who moved * on with my life. There must of been * plenty of women for you over the years. *
INDY There were a few. But, they all had the * same problem. *
The rope breaks and her hands pop free. *
Indy moves to the center of the truck he looks around for a way * out of the truck. He looks up, at the canvas roof overhead. He * uses the knife to cut an opening . *
MARION yeah, what was that? *
INDY they weren’t you, honey.
Well, that just melts her. She looks at Indy. *
Mutt’s knife blade RIPS through the canvas a d tears a hole big * enough for Indy to wriggle through. He pulls himself up and onto the top of the truck. *
* *
86 OMIT

91. 10/16/07
87 INSIDE THE TRUCK, Mutt and Marion are staring up at Indy’s silhouette, visible *
* through the canvas as he stands atop the truck. *
They watch the silhouette move toward the front of the truck, leap into the air -- *
The truck swerves and SMASHES into a tree, throwing Mutt and Marion forward violently.
91A.
		88  IN THE CAB OF THE TRUCK, * Indy throws the Driver out, and slides behind the wheel. * 
		89  WITH THE CONVOY, we THUNDER through the jungle, the jungle-cutter SHRIEKING and  GASHING its way through the foliage. 
		90  INT TRUCK DAY  Indy’s now driving the truck , he slides open the window to the * back of the truck. Marion slides out and joins him. She smiles at * him. *  INDY We have to get Oxley back, get our hands  on that skull, and get to Akator before they do. *  (to Marion) Grab the wheel. *  And like that, he’s gone, clambering into the back of the truck as Marion slides over into the driver’s seat.  Mutt slides out and joins her. * MUTT *  What’s he gonna do now? *  MARION * I don’t think he plans that far ahead. * 
92. A LARGE BAZOOKA emerges from the back of the truck and pokes into *
the front seat between them, warhead first.
MUTT * Indy leans out the opening, hoisting the bazooka up on his *
shoulder.
GAH!
Scooch over, son? * MUTT
INDY (to Mutt)
Don’t call me son. * But Mutt flattens himself against the seat as Indy swings the
head of the bazooka around, pointing out the passenger window.
Up ahead, the convoy is rounding a bend in the river, which means there’s an open expanse of water between the lead vehicle, the one with the saw blades, and the rear vehicle, the one Indy and the others are in.
Indy sights over the barrel of the bazooka --
INDY Might wanna cover your-
-- “ears” is what he means to say, but before anybody can --- *
93.
		91  ON THE RIVER,  the explosive head of the bazooka BLASTS out the passenger window of the rear truck, SCREAMS across the open water, SLAMS into the lead truck --  -- and the truck EXPLODES, turning a cartwheel. Its whirling saw blades are blown free, ripping through the jungle like runaway airplane propellers. 
		92  THE SECOND TRUCK,  swerves, narrowly missing the wreckage. Spalko and the others duck as ONE OF THE WHIRRING SAW BLADES SCREAMS over their heads, missing them by inches.  They come to a stop. Spalko stands and grabs the sack with the * skull. * 
94.
		93  HALF THE CONVOY  SMASHES into itself, a chain reaction pile-up. The WHIRRING SAW BLADE slices through the air over the top of the convoy, headed toward the back, where -- 
		94  IN THE REAR TRUCK, -- Marion, Indy and Mutt duck, there is the horrible SHRIEKING  sound of tearing metal, and when they sit up --  -- THE TRUCK’S ROOF IS GONE. 
		95  IN THE SECOND VEHICLE,  Spalko holding the sack with the skull, looks back and sees the * contrail still hanging in the air fro the rear vehicle, where Indy shot the bazooka.  OXLEY * Henry Jones Junior. *  She SHOUTS to the Driver of the jeep, who pushes the accelerator * to the floor. *  SPALKO * Vawn atsuda! (go, go, go) *  As the jeep barrels through the jungle, Spalko chases it and * hands the sack to Mac. *  SPALKO (cont’d) * ZASHCHISHCHAITE CHERIP(Protect the * skull!) *  -- She leaps onto the jeep just behind her. * SPALKO (cont’d) *  Slyeduiti za nimi (Follow them!) * The Russian Soldier at the wheel keeps driving as she climbs in *  and grabs an automatic weapon from one of the soldiers. * One of the soldiers (Pasha) yells after her *  PASHA * Who caused this? * 
Jones!
SPALKO * *
94A. 96 IN THE REAR OF THE TRUCK,
Indy lands in the front seat of the cab, he SHOUTS to Marion, * who’s still driving the truck, pointing at the vehicle in front of them. It’s a duck (half truck half boat) with two Russian Soldiers in it.
INDY Pull up alongside that duck!
Marion hits the gas and the truck gains on the duck. They drive by Pasha, he gets his rifle and fires at them. * She pulls right up next to it, the Russians on board open fire --
-- and Indy leaps through the air, landing in the front of the Russians' duck, fighting with the Driver and the Shooter.
95.
		97  IN THE BACK OF THE TRUCK,  Dovchenko regains consciousness and sees the Driver and the Shooter as they’re hurled out of the duck and land in the jungle foliage.  He turns and sees the duck through the torn side of the truck, and now Indy’s at the wheel, beckoning to Mutt and Marion to jump aboard.  Mutt jumps, Marion legs go of the wheel and jumps --  -- and Dovchenko leaps into the front seat of the truck, taking over the wheel before the truck crashes. 
		98  IN THE DUCK, Indy hits the gas and passes the truck, quickly catching up to  the racing jeep with Spalko in it. Spalko sees Indy approaching. She points with her right hand. *  SPALKO (TO THE DRIVER) * Idiot! On Yedit! ( he’s coming) *  But Spalko’s on her feet, and armed. She swings her weapon around and opens fire. 
99 IN INDY’S DUCK, Marion sees it coming.
GET DOWN!
MARION
She grabs Indy. Mutt jumps up from the back, covers Marion and * pulls them down a split-second before the windshield SHATTERS.
Spalko keeps firing and Indy slows down, which means her weapon’s BLASTING right at the jeep with Mac and Oxley and the Russian * soldiers. The bullets miss them. *
Mac takes off his hat and checks to make sure he is alright. *
MAC * Bloody Russians (he taps the driver in * the shoulder) No disrespect comrade. *

95A.
100 ININDY’SDUCK, Indy’s caught up to the lead vehicle, the jeep which has Oxley,
Mac, and the skull in it.
INDY (to Marion)
Ox has the skull. Marion take the wheel! * Marion takes over and they pull up alongside the jeep. Indy starts to get up. *

Mutt attacks, one foot on each vehicle, and they start to move apart. He’s clinging to both vehicles, splitting in half like a wishbone. Spalko finds it amusing. *
Indy drives his duck towards Spalko’s jeep. *
The jeeps come together again and Spalko lunges, Mutt parries and they spin around, falling backwards into each others’ vehicles.

10/16/07
Mutt’s swept right up into the treetops, and lands, out of breath and off balance, on a thick branch. He watches in panic as, below, the jeeps race away without him. He turns --
-- AND SEES FIFTY MONKEYS ARE STARING AT HIM.
The monkeys one by one leap onto the vines, swinging away from * Mutt.
Mutt grabs hold of a vine -- * -- and swings away.
With the monkeys ahead of and behind him, Mutt swings on a vine after vine, closing in on the convoy below.
100A.
		114  DOWNBELOW,  Spalko’s jeep chases Indy in the truck, and now they’re running along the edge of a sheer cliff that drops five hundred feet straight down to the raging Amazon.  Spalko SHOUTS at the Driver in Russian and slides over, taking the wheel.  SPALKO * Shivilyiteves!

the skull in it.
Monkeys pour into the jeep, Mutt leaps over the windshield, onto the hood, the Russian Soldier grabs the wheel as Mutt jumps --

		122  ININDY’SJEEP,  Indy’s eyes widen as he sees a huge dirt pile up ahead, blocking their way completely.  INDY * Whoaaaaa! *  Spalko sees the dirt pile approaching. *  The jeep goes airborne and SLAMS into the side of the soft dirt mound. 
102. 10/16/07
A moment later, there’s a ROAR as Spalko’s jeep flies into the air above them, SLAMS down on top, and RUMBLES past them, coming to rest near the top of the strange dirt pile.
Spalko pulls a gun from the holster of one of the Russian * Soldiers.
Indy and his group come to and stat to move out, they see * Spalko with the gun aimed at them -- *
-- and AN ANT, at least five inches long, crawls out onto her hand!
The ant sinks its pincers into the soft webbing between her * fingers.
She takes her left hand and swats the ant, blood pours out. *
Suddenly DOZENS OF ANTS pour into the Russian vehicle, through * the air vents, out from around the pedals, materializing from * everywhere. *
A THOUSAND MORE ANTS pour from the soft mount -- which is an ant * hill, we now realize, for red army ants, ferocious and huge. *
INDY (cont’d) * SIAFU! GET OUT OF HERE!
As TENS OF THOUSANDS OF SIAFU stream out of the ant hill, Oxley grabs the burlap bag, Mac grabs Oxley, Indy grabs Mutt, and the four of them take off downhill. *
Spalko and her driver (Lee) chase them * but the Russian truck driven by Dovchenko ROARS out of the
jungle. Dovchenko leaps out of the truck and tackles Indy. * Dov lifts Indy off the ground, * Indy yells to the others to keep going. *
INDY (cont’d) * Go! Get to the river! Go! *
They start to fight. *
102A.
		123  ON THE GROUND, *  Oxley stumbles and falls in the mayhem. *  Mac and Mutt barrel toward the river, but the Russians in the * truck pull even with them and raise their weapons. Mac and Mutt * are dead for sure, but just as the Russians open fire -- *  -- A RAMPAGING DUCK ROARS up in front of the Russians with Marion * at the wheel! * 
		124  IN THE DUCK, * Marion ducks as the Russian GUNFIRE SCREECHES off the metal sides *  of the duck. * But it allows Mutt and Mac to jump in from the other side, *  keeping low. * Marion hits the gas and they take off toward the river. But they *  soon reach a short cliff. *  Marion stomps on the brakes and looks over the edge. She sees * they’re only about twenty or thirty feet above the river, and * there’s a large tree halfway down. *  She turns the duck around, but she’s thinking something. * 
103.
		125  BACK UPHILL, *  Indy and Dovchenko are in a fistfight for the ages, and Indy’s * getting his ass kicked. *  Indy rams into Dov, they fall to the ground. Indy punches him * while he is on top of him. Dov pouts his left hand on Indy’s face * and pushes him off. Dov stands and grabs Indy by the ear- Indy * gets up and punches Dov, once, twice, on the third one Dov ducks, * Indy misses, Dov punches Indy on the side- Indy falls back to the * ground- Dov takes Indy’s hat off and pulls him by the hair with * his left hand, he punches Indy back to the ground again. *  Worse the river of ants is heading right toward them. Just as the * ants are about to swarm over all of them, Oxley, who’s still on * the ground nearby, holds the Crystal Skull, he slowly removes the * covering, the light gleams off it -- *  -- and the ants immediately divide into two columns and go right * around them and the skull. * 
		126  NEARBY, * Spalko, on foot now with a Russian Soldier, is racing toward *  where the fistfight’s going on. *  But the ants overtake them. They swarm over the Soldier, * dragging him down. Spalko moves up on a tree trunk, backing up * away from the ants. The ants continue to move towards her, * Spalko sees a vine, she jumps up and grabs it. She is hanging * above the ants. The ants start to make a ladder by climbing on * each other, trying to reach Spalko’s feet. Spalko climbs higher * on the vine. One ant has managed to get on her leg, Spalko snaps * her legs together and squashes the ant. *  SPALKO * Idisuda!(ee-dee-soo-DAH) *  * 
103A.
		127  BACKATTHEFIGHT,  Indy is now bleeding in his nose and mouth. Indy on his back barely turns around and starts to crawl towards his hat, he is about to pick it up but instead he picks up a large tree stick with his right hand. Indy turns quickly and hits Dov with the stick, and then punches him four times, Dovchenko lands flat on his back --  -- in the middle of the sea of ants. They immediately overcome him, going in his ears, his mouth, his nostrils -- and then start biting to make holes of their own.  Dovchenko’s body starts to move, horizontally along the ground, floating six inches above the jungle floor.  The Russian SCREAMS as the army ants carry him away to another dirt mound and drag him down into it, to devour him in peace.  Indy’s hat is also being carried by the ants into the anthill. Indy walks up holding the skull, the ants move away, he picks up his hat puts it on and moves towards Oxley 
		128  THERUSSIANTRUCK, now fleeing the army ants like everybody else, reaches the edge  of the cliff Marion saw earlier.  The Soldiers pour out, carrying ropes and gear to rappel down the cliff, anything to escape the ants.  Spalko gets out looks back, gets her rope and starts to head down.  SPALKO Da vai, da vai,(DUHvye, DUH VYE) GO GO  NOW!

But the duck nearly goes under in a set of rapids. *

point, and all five heads pop back up above the surface. * 141 EXT RIVERBANK DAY
One by one, Indy, Marion, Mac, Mutt, and Oxley drag themselves onto the riverbank and lie there, GASPING.
Indy helps Oxley to dry ground. * He walks over to Marion and turns her toward him, making sure *
she’s all right. She’s soaked and breathless, but she’s fine. INDY *
Honey you alright? You okay? *
He grabs the wheel and yanks it off her hands. *

108. 10/16/07
Oxley sits, facing away. He takes the burlap bag and places it * in front of him, rotating it to face in the direction he’s looking.
A low-end vibration starts, barely audible at first, coming from the skull. Tiny pebbles and bits of dirt on the ground around it are jumping lightly into the air.
Indy walks over to Oxley and follows his gaze. There, towering above them, A GREAT STONE HEAD is carved into the cliffs on the shores of the river.
OXLEY
Through eyes that last I saw in tears...
Mutt looks up suddenly, recognizing those words.
MUTT (finishing the quote)
“the golden vision reappears!” It’s T.S. * Eliot! You made me read it. *
(to the others) “Through eyes that last I saw in tears, here in death’s dream kingdom, the golden vision reappears!”
MAC gold?! I’m in. *
Mutt’s still thinking, looking up at the cliff. He sees that a waterfall runs out of the left eye of the carved face.
MUTT Through eyes in tears, we go through the
waterfall! Indy looks at him, impressed, then looks back up at the cliffs.
109.
10/16/07
INDY This skull has to be returned. I’ll do
it. Nobody else has to come.

Slowly, they all turn and look at the skull. We move in close on it, and as we draw in --
DISSOLVE TO:

110. 10/17/07 144 EXT RIVER’SEDGE DAY
The wreckage of the duck that Indy and the others rode over the falls is washed up on the shore of the river. Irina Spalko and the few remaining Russian Soldiers, their arms and necks inflamed by the pincer marks of the army ants, have just hacked their way through the jungle at the rive’s edge. They’re still carrying the ropes and other gear they used to rappel down the cliff face at the river.
Spalko picks up one of the diode from the floor, she glances down * at it. She looks out across the water and sees-- *
--the Giant Face carved into the cliffs of Akator. * She suddenly weakens, overcome by a powerful feeling. *
SPALKO Into the water. *
145 INT CAVE DAY
Indy helps Oxley get Indy leads them into are struck by a cave walls as Indy gently group of squat human
up into the cave, Marion holds onto his arm. the cave- Mac is holding a flashlight. The painting in front of them. CLOSE ON the cave touches the first painting, a depiction of a figures, hands stretched aloft to the sun.
110A.
INDY (feeling the materials)
Ochre... iron oxide....charcoal...
MAC How old is this?
INDY Four, five thousand years, old as the
pyramids. Sun worshippers like the Egyptians.
While Indy studies the painting, Mutt notices there are a series of torch-holders in the walls. There are smears of black reside above them, and Mutt runs his fingers over them. The residue comes off on his skin.
MUTT these are fresh. These were just used.
But the others are too distracted by the paintings to pay attention.
though.
Someone came.
INDY (cont’d)
111.
They move to the next panel. The group of humans are looking up at the sky as a figure is lowering form the heavens -- humanoid, but taller, thinner, glowing.
MARION More worshippers.
INDY That’s not the sun they’re worshipping
They keep moving. There are more alien figures now, and they’re moving among the human figures, building, farming.
INDY (cont’d) Taught the Ugha -- farming, irrigation --
Oxley holding onto the burlap bag with the skull, moves into another room he sees---
The next drawing a more detailed version of the visitor, just its torso and cranium, in profile.
Oxley reaches into his bag, pulls out the Crystal Skull. Indy and the rest of the group enter the room.
MARION Ox, what is it?
Indy hands the torch to Mutt and approaches Oxley, he reaches for the skull. Oxley is hesitant to give it up.
INDY I understand.
Indy takes it and moves closer to the wall .... CHANGED THE ACTION: new action
Oxley and the rest of the group enter the room. Marion moves to Oxley she puts her hand on his shoulder.
MARION Ox, what is it?
Indy hands the torch to Mutt and moves in front of Oxley.
111A.
INDY I think I understand Ox. Someone came.
Indy looks at the painting, mesmerized. Oxley takes the skull and raises it with his right hand, creating a shadow
He holds it up against the painting -- -- and it’s an exact match.
MARION is this the same as that? (or ) Are they
the same? Indy has been looking at another painting behind them.
INDY It’s not the only one. (or) there were
more, look in a circle.
He moves to the next picture, a group of shots of a circle of the taller figures, all grouped around a central area.
Oxley moves ahead of them, Indy joins him.
INDY (cont’d) Show us the way, Ox.
Oxley moves slowly at first, then starts to pick up speed. They move ahead, into a darker antechamber. It’s harder to make out the paintings here, but the scale is massive.
They pass through the cave and into --
112. 146 INT CAVEROTUNDA DAY
-- a large rotunda area. Above them, there are thirteen skulls carved into the ceiling. As they pass underneath, one of the skulls OPENS ITS EYES.
The eyes follow the humans passing below, and then the thin rock starts to chip away as a form presses into it from above.
It’s a REAL Ugha warrior.
Now all the skulls start to open their eyes and we realize these are surveillance perches, there’s a whole system of tunnels up above them.
The UGHA WARRIORS SWARM DOWN FROM THE CEILING, they start to follow Oxley and the group
Indy, Mac, Marion and Mutt stop they hear something. Oxley up ahead stops, listens.
OXLEY “to lay their just hands on that golden
Key...that ope’s the Palace of Eternity.”
He repeats is several times. Marion joins him.
MARION Shhh, listen.
They stop. Indy realizes what is happening.
INDY Let’s go. Go, go, go....
They all take off, barreling through the rotunda toward the sliver of light at the far end.
-- The SHRIEKING UGHA WARRIORS ARE FLYING OWN TOWARD THE GROUP!
The Warrior whirls a BOLA BELT over its head (so that was the whirling helicopter blade image)
112A.
--UGHA WARRIORS SWARM DOWN FROM THE CEILING, jumping, swinging, climbing down on vines.
Indy rips the bola from around Mutt’s neck, drags him to his feet, and they all take off, barreling through the rotunda toward the sliver of light at the far end.
113.
		147  EXT CAVEENTRANCE DAY  Mayhem spills out of the mouth of the cave -- Indy, Mac, Marion, and Mutt, pursued by a dozen SHRIEKING WARRIORS and WHIRLING bolas.  Oxley takes off down a set of carved steps toward -- 
		148  --AKATOR.  The ruins of the city are set in a hollow depression in the center of the plateau-atop-a-plateau, rimmed by clouds, with a huge, man- made reservoir carved into the hilltop above it.  Though the jungle has grown up around it, we can see its spiral design radiates out from a Great Stone Temple. The pathways are smooth and straight, bordered by aqueducts which carry the water, flowing from the reservoir above, throughout the city, and plunging down into the base of the temple itself.  Indy is running with Oxley, suddenly they are knocked to the ground by the bolas.  Mac falls.  Marion falls. One of the holes WHAPS through the air, wraps around Mutt’s neck--  -and SLAMS him to the floor.  The warriors surround Marion and Mutt. Mutt takes his knife and cuts the bolas off his neck. He moves next to Marion trying to protect her. 
MARION Mac sees the Warriors around him and he also yells.
MAC JONESEY!!!
Indy looks around, knows they’re not going to win this fight. He SHOUTS to Oxley, desperate:
INDY Oxley! You were here before, how did you
get past ‘em! The warriors move in closer with their spears, suddenly they stop
Indy!!!
Oxley, Marion.
INDY (cont’d)
114.
Oxley gets up with the skull in his hands -- -- and holds it over his head.
The skull catches the light of the sun and refracts out through the lensed eyes in brilliant beams. The light streams out everywhere, through the ears, the nose, the mouth, and the low HUM we heard before gets louder, the skull vibrating madly, actually BLURRING in Oxley’s hands as he holds it over his head.
To a man, the Ugha warriors freeze in their tracks, starting at the skull in terrified fascination.
Indy grabs onto Oxley as the Ughas shrink back.
Indy pulls Oxley along, they make their way towards Mac. The Ugha are afraid to follow them.
INDY (cont’d)
C’mon Mac. Mac crawls towards Marion and Mutt.
OXLEY “To lay their just hands on that golden
Key...that ope’s the Palace of Eternity.”
INDY You did good Ox.
They reach Marion and Mutt. They take off, toward the temple in the distance.
They reach the temple and scamper up its terraced sides. The Ugha do not follow.
114A. 149 ONTOPOFTHESTONETEMPLE,
the group staggers onto the flat top of the temple. There’s a * large square box filled with sand, and a fifteen foot stone obelisk lying on its side. One end of the obelisk is supported by a cut-out chunk of hillside, the heavier and lying in the center
of the stone box. Mac looks around. *
MAC * The city of gold, so where’s the gold? *
He throws a piece of artifact on the ground in disgust. *
MAC (cont’d) * Look at the state of this place! * What a stupid legend. What a waste of my * time.
Indy is standing by the top of the steps with Oxley. Oxley goes * down the steps. Indy follows him. *
Mutt squats down watching them, Marion stands next to him. *
INDY * Ox was here before, but he couldn’t get * into the temple, so he put the skull back * to he cemetery where he found it. *
Oxley bends down and picks up a handful of sand, he pours it into * Indy’s hand. *
OXLEY
“To lay their just hands on that Golden Key... that ope’s the Palace of Eternity.”
Indy grins and turns to Oxley, pointing at the obelisk.
INDY Golden key, right? *
(to the others) This obelisk, is the key to getting into * the temple. *
Indy leans on the obelisk. *
115.
OXLEY * To lay their just hands on that golden * key... *
Oxley starts to walk around the obelisk. * INDY *
That’s it, that’s it! * Indy follows Oxley around the obelisk. *
OXLEY * That ope’s the Palace of Eternity. * Through eyes that last I saw in * tears....Here In death’s dream * kingdom....gold vision Reappears *
INDY * What are you doing Ox? What are you * looking for? *
Oxleystopsinfrontofoneofthestoneheads.Asmalltrickleof * sand is running out from around the edges of a plug of some kind, * one of a series of such plugs. *
INDY (cont’d) * You figured(worked) this out in your * cell didn’t you Professor? Well done. *
He gets an idea, goes to pick up a stone. * Mac moves in to look at the plugs. *
MAC * Excuse me Professor. *
As Mac looks at the stone, Indy , holding a huge chunk of rock * over his head, moves forward toward Mac, ROARING with effort. *
INDY * Move please. (Just move please Mac) *
Mac turns and reacts. * MAC *
Don’t kill me! * Mutt’s face lights up, he gets it, he also goes to get a rock. *
Mac lunges out of the way as Indy SLAMS the rock down on the square stone plug at the base of the stone box. Thee plug gets * loose and a stream of sand flows out of the hole. *
Indy turns and gives the rock to Mac stone head, and more sand flows out. Mac.
INDY Go get one of your own.

115A.
Mutt enters with a rock and SLAMS it into another plug. More * sand flows out. *
Now Indy and Mutt move quickly from plug to plug, SMASHING them with rocks, KICKING the plugs out, sand rushing onto the ground. *
Now Mac and Marion pitch in, kicking plugs out, shoving the rocks * away to let the sand flow freely out of the pit. *
Oxley is seated nearby watching them with a smile. He looks up. *
116. 150 EXT THE STONE BOX DAY *
Indy hits the last stone off the base. As the level of sand goes * down, the base of the obelisk, which was resting on that sand * also goes down. *
Indy hears the rumble, he stand and looks to see, ten tons of * stone- aided only by gravity, slowly move to vertical. *
As the base goes down, the four horizontal pillars, start to rise * into the air. Indy and the others watch. The four obelisk pieces * click together. *
The floor of the pit starts to RUMBLE and GROAN * The rest of the sand falls away quickly from below the group, *
they fall through with the sand onto -- * A SET OF STAIRS in a darkened area. * Indy sits up. *
INDY * Listen you hear that? *
They all sit up. It’s not over!
*
INDY (cont’d) * *
Ma!
MUTT
116A.
151 INT TEMPLE DAY A mechanism trips and the steps start to retract, into the walls.
The group gets up and starts to descend the stairs. Oxley is in front, he is holding the skull in his arms wrapped under his serape. Indy is behind him. They leap as they race down, trying to get to the bottom before the steps disappear completely.
INDY Let’s go , move faster. Move, move. This
is not good. Move Ox, move. Faster Ox. Indy looks back and sees that Marion is falling behind.
INDY (cont’d) Go back(get) and help your mother.
Mutt stops and waits for Marion
MARION Don’t stop for me, keep going.
Marion catches up, Mutt gives her his hand, they continue down.
As the group heads down, we drop down to their feet, to their footprints, the stairs getting smaller.
Indy puts his back against the wall, the other follow, the stairs keep retracting.
Indy falls, one by one they all fall. The group has landed on water. Marion is coughing. Mutt sees that Oxley has lost the skull. They begin their search. Mac looks around for gold.
MAC where’s your gold mate?
He finds a coin, puts it away. Indy helps Marion.
INDY Are you alright? (You okay?)
Yeah.
MARION
MUTT (cont’d)
Ox, here. Oxley takes it and embraces it.
OXLEY The golden visionary reappears.
He covers it. Mutt starts to walk away, stops.
MUTT Let’s go.
He walks further away, stops and looks at Indy.
MUTT (cont’d) Indy heads out the others follow.
This way?
116B.
Marion embraces Indy, they have a moment and look at each other. Suddenly Mutt comes up with a soldier skeleton and hands it to Indy.
MUTT Here hold this.
He continues to search for the skull in the water. He finds it and hands it to Oxley.

153A INT CORRIDOR DAY
*
117. 10/4/07
A hundred feet below ground level, Indy, Marion, Oxley, Mutt and * Mac enter a corridor, away from the sunlight above. But the * light seems to follow them, streaming through strategically * placed fissures in the temple walls and bouncing off smoothly * polished areas on the stone surfaces. *
As they move on, they notice precious jewels, set in ornate * silver settings and hung upon the walls. Mac CHIPS one out of the wall, drops it in his pocket, grinning to himself as he studies the dozens ahead. *
Indy leads them to a large opening, in the middle of the corridor * are large quartz shapes hanging in the ceiling. Mutt moves * closer and touches one of them. *
MUTT * What is it? *
INDY * I have no idea. (you’re asking me?) *
Indy moves on, they all follow. *
118. 9/30/07 154 INT ANTECHAMBER DAY
* The group come down the stairs into an opening. Indy puts the *
torch down and heads down, the group follows him * The room is very different, it is full of things. *
Mac studies the room, but it’s the bracelets and rings that he’s * interested in. *
MAC * That’s more like it! *
They walk cross further into the room. * There are niches all over the wall, crammed with antiquities *
from every era imaginable. Indy marvels at them: *
INDY * Artifacts, from every era of * mankind(early history). * Macedonian...Sumerian... *
MUTT * This place is the mother lode. *
INDY * Struscan...Babylonian... *
MAC * there’s not a museum on earth(in the * world) wouldn’t sell its soul for this * lot. *
INDY * Early Egyptian. *
MAC * A dozen museums, a hundred of them, * Jonesy! *
Mac walks away. *
INDY * Collectors. (a grin) They were * archaeologists. (he realizes that Ox is * not next to him) Ox? , Ox? *
Oxley walked over to the side of the chamber, there are two giant * doors, seemingly carved from a single giant block of iron ore. *
He uncovers the skull, the skull starts to vibrate. *
119. 10/1/07 Mac walks around the room and begins to fill his pockets with *
coins, jewelry and precious stones. *
Marion walks over the touches the skull, she takes her hand away. * Mutt joins them and also touches the vibrating skull, Indy joins * them. *
MUTT * How do we open it? *
Indy looks and sees the recess that is over the head of the door. * And it’s empty. *
Indy sizes it up, thinking. * He turns to Oxley and reaches for the skull. Oxley hesitates, but *
Indy puts his hands gently on the skull. * INDY *
I’ll give it back, Harold. * Reluctantly, Oxley lets it go. *
INDY (cont’d) * I promise. *
Indy moves to the door and shoves the Crystal Skull into the * recess above the door. It fits perfectly, as if the recess was a * mold. *
Immediately, the skull glows, brighter than it ever had, and all * at once-- *
Indy steps back to the group. * Mac joins them, he is now loaded with bracelets and rings in his *
pockets and around his neck. *
The doors begin to GROAN, the arrows comes down pushing the * balls down, the zig zag door opens. They RUMBLE open slowly, and * SLAM all the way to he bottom, revealing-- *
119A.
155 INT TEMPLEHEART DAY -- a blindingly lit room.
Indy pulls the skull free from the recess, hops back to the ground, and hands it back to Oxley. They all come inside, blinking at the room’s radiance.
It’s round, built in the style of the time, along the lines of a throne room. Carved totems fill every nook and crannny. *
And there, seated upright in a circle atop a massive circular altar are THIRTEEN FLAWLESS CRYSTAL SKELETONS, nearly seven feet * tall each.
Oxley sees one in particular--because it has no skull atop its * shoulders. Oxley still holding the skull, starts to walk forward, * toward the altar that holds the headless body-- *
OXLEY * (softly, to the skull)
No more forever waiting soon now. Oxley uncovers the skull and aims it towards the altar. * They all stare transfixed -- *
120.
10/16/07
-- and Indy hears a CLICK behind him. He turns around. Mac is pointing a gun at them.
MAC Sorry, old son(Jonesy)
INDY Why don’t you make up your mind, which
side our on?
MARION I’m getting REALLY tired of this guy.
MAC (calling out)
Ya evo poimal!(got him)
And now, from the entrance to the final chamber -- -- the four Russian Soldier step into the room. Indy looks back at Mac, more irritated than anything.
*
*
* *
*
*
INDY So you’re what? A triple agent? *
MAC Nah, I just lied about being a double.
(to Marion) Don’t worry, you can come with us.
MARION HAH! Fat chance. *
121. 10/2/07 Spalko enters the room, a rush runs through her body, and she *
looks up at the others, eyes shining.
SPALKO Look at them.
She comes up the steps . *
SPALKO (cont’d) * Still waiting. For the return of the one * who was lost. *
She looks around the room at the twelve others. *
SPALKO (cont’d) They’re a hive mind, one being, physically separate, but with a
collective consciousness. More powerful together than they could ever be apart.
She walks up to Oxley and gently takes the Crystal Skull from * Oxley’s hands and regards it, alas-poor-Yorick style. *
SPALKO (cont’d)
Imagine what they’ll tell us.
She walks toward the altar that contains the headless body. *
INDY I can’t imagine. *
(she turns, looks at him) Neither could the humans who built this temple, and neither can you.
She starts to climb the altar, toward the mummy. *
SPALKO Belief, Dr. Jones, is a gift you have
yet to receive. My sympathies. *
INDY Oh, I believe, sister. That’s why I’m * down here. *
Atop the altar now, she raises the skull toward the mummy. A magnetic field grabs it out of her hand, pulling it forward --
-- and sucking it into place atop the mummy’s shoulders.
122. 10/2/07 A RUMBLING rises up in the room, the bodies themselves begin to *
vibrate. *
Viscous fluids flow through the stone, these were living things, * and they’re coming back to life. The main skeleton, the one to * which the Crystal skull was returned, blurs and its flesh * returns, soft, living flesh once again, eyes that see, hands that * move. *
Spalko backs up back to the group. *
Oxley, who is staring at the skeleton, transfixed, moves towards * the altar and begins to speak, low and rapid. But it isn’t * English, it’s-- *
Indy and Spalko move next to Oxley * INDY (cont’d) *
Mayan. He’s speaking Mayan. * SPALKO *
What does he say? * Oxley’s lips moving rapidly, strange, ancient sounds coming out *
of his mouth. * Indy listens, Oxley, is still talking. Indy tries to decipher. *
INDY * He says he’s grateful, he wants-- * (correcting himself, he means the * skeleton)-- *
Indy turns and looks at the skeleton. * INDY (cont’d) *
--it wants to give us a gift. * The Being seems to look right back at him. Spalko moves closer to *
the altar. * INDY (cont’d) *
A big gift. * Spalko is speaking to the figure on the altar, low, fervent, *
almost a prayer. *
SPALKO * Tell me-- everything you know, I want it * all, I want to know -- *
The skeleton sees her and seems to respond. *
Something has begun. Indy moves back next to Mutt.
INDY I’ve got a bad feeling about this.
*
* *
122A.
10/2/07
Spalko is transfixed. She locks eyes with the Main skeleton. * Marion is amazed too staring at them. *
MARION * Indy, their eyes! *
-- the RUMBLING grows louder, and the stone walls of the room * crack and crumble. *
Mac knows a bad situation when he sees it. He takes off out of * the opening is starting to move away, he ducks out into the * tunnel that leads to the antechamber. *
The sides of the room start to spin, slowly at first, but gaining * speed, like a centrifuge. *
MUTT * What are they, space-men?! *
Harold Oxley is suddenly and completely restored to his normal * self. *
OXLEY * Inter-dimensional beings, in point of * fact. *
INDY * (surprised) Welcome back, Ox. *
A swirling black sinkhole forms in the center of the whirling * room. *
MARION * What the hell is that? *
OXLEY * A portal! A pathway! *
INDY * I don’t think we want to go that way. *
Indy moves Oxley and Marion and pushes them out the exit. *
Indy and Mutt wait for the room to make another circle , and then * they bolt for the exit. *
122B. 10/2/07
The soldiers chase after them, they are sucked up into the * ceiling by the spinning walls. Spalko’s face glows in the * brilliant light of the Skull’s eyes. The walls of the room are a * blur of motion now. The skeletons surround her. *
But Spalko remains, still staring into the eyes again. *
SPALKO * I want to know! I want to know! I can * see, I can see. Cover it. *
		A157  INT. TEMPLE HEART-DAY *  In the throne room, the walls are spinning faster now, Spalko * continues to stare, eyes wide, temples throbbing. This is what * she came for. *

123. 10/2/07 156 INT ANTECHAMBER DAY
* Mac comes out of the tunnel and starts to head up the stairs. He *
stops and heads back down, he starts to pick up more loot. * Oxley with Marion come through the tunnel. Marion wants to go *
back, Oxley stops her. * OXLEY *
Don’t even think about it. * Indy with Mutt enter the antechamber through the tunnel. Marion *
makes sure that Mutt is alright. * MUTT *
I am fine. * Marion goes to Indy, they embrace. * Mutt goes to Oxley. *
MUTT (cont’d) * Ox? Do you know who I am? *
OXLEY * Multiple dimensions! Fascinating to * ponder Mutt! Mignon Thorne wrote an * interesting perspective, teased out the * notion of changeable physics -- *
Indy realizes that something is happening. * INDY *
NOT A GOOD TIME FOR THIS, OX! * He pushes them up the stairs. Indy stops, Mac comes up from *
behind the artifacts. * MAC *
I winked(I always winked). * Indy puts his finger up. *
INDY * Nyet. *
The look at each other. Indy joins the group and they head out. * Mac goes back to gathering more loot. *
OXLEY * Changeable physics a bit like eddy in * water, what with hot and cold spots, see * what I’m getting at? *
123A. 10/2/07 Indy stops at the top of the stairs, he turns and calls Mac. *
INDY * Mac come on! Mac! *
Mac keeps picking up more stuff. Indy goes down closer to Mac. * INDY (cont’d) *
Mac! Now! * Mac looks at him, but he moves to another area and keeps picking *
up things. * INDY (cont’d) *
Mac! Damn it! * Behind Mac, the black sinkhole is coming forward. Mac turns and *
moves towards Indy, he’s pulled to the ground. * The sinkhole is advancing toward Mac, and the denseness of its *
gravity is pulling him and everything else toward it-- * Mac looks up at Indy, knows he’s in a serious jam. *
Indy takes out his whip and throws the handle to Mac. Mac grabs * onto it. Mac continues to be drawn toward the pit *
INDY (cont’d) * Come on Mac, use your feet (legs). I * can’t do it alone. *
Mac’s face falls, there’s no way out of this. * MAC *
Jonesy I’m gonna be alright. * He winks. He lets go of the whip, his body is immediately sucked, *
into the void. *
Indy falls back onto the stairs, takes one last look stands and * heads out with the rest of the group. The stairs right behind * them are behind sucked away. *
C158 INT. TEMPLE HEART-DAY
*
123B. 10/2/07
the sides of the temple room whirl faster and faster, just a blur * now, and Spalko tears her away from the gaze of the bodies * they’re facing, but when she turns around-- *
--ONE OF THE BODIES IS STANDING RIGHT BEHIND HER. * It seems impossible that it got there so quickly, but there are *
its eyes, shining even BRIGHTER, so she turns again-- * --and THERE’S TWO MORE OF THEM on the other side of her, right *
there, eyes beaming righter still. * SPALKO *
COVER IT! COVER IT! * * *
*
124. 10/2/07
But there’s no one left to cover it and she’s in he center of a * circle, so everywhere she turns, there is a body standing right * there, its eyes burning like laser beams. *
Spalko starts to BABBLE in that alien language the body spoke, * otherworldly sounds coming out of her, fast, and now she SCREAMS as it all pours into her, too much, far too much, the veins in her temples throb and swell -- *
-- her eyes drip blood, but she doesn’t collapse, she stays on her feet. *
Smoke curls up from her eyes, her eyeballs flutter and bounce, as * if her brain is boiling water and they’re floating on top of it, she SCREAMS -- *
SPALKO (cont’d) * I can still see!!! *
-- GEYSERS OF FLAME burst from her eyes.
It flairs up, hollowing out her eye sockets, and whatever was left of her eyes burns out and drips down her face, dark, black matter --
-- and her arms drop to her sides, lifeless, revealing two oversized, black, hollow eye sockets, just like the corpses outside the door.
She falls to the ground, dead.
And at that very moment, the Thirteen Crystal Skeletons begin to vanish, one by one. They don’t disappear, or get in a ship and fly away, it’s more that they slip away, turning sideways and sliding into thin air, or another dimension, or someplace we cannot grasp. *
The sinkhole in the center of the room both implodes and explodes * at the same time, sucking everything into it and expanding at the * same time. *

126. 10/4/07 157 INT TEMPLE CORRIDOR DAY
*
Indy and the others race into the corridor with the quartz * hangings from the ceiling. Everything continues to get sucked * back into the sinkhole. Oxley’s still making his point. *
OXLEY * Migno Thorne called them, “Post- * inflation bubbles,” assuming universal * expansion-- *
Indy runs to one end of the hallways, the walls are EXPLODING * with rocks blocking the way out. Indy runs back to another * corridor. *
OXLEY (cont’d) * --and therefore random pockets of * extrinsic physics-- *
INDY * Ox! *
OXLEY * What? *
INDY * Ox shut up! *
Indy takes off, they all follow. * C158 INT. TEMPLE CORRIDOR DAY * Indy and the group come out to an opening. *

128. 10/17/07 158 INT TEMPLE - ASCENDING TUNNEL DAY *
They race through an ascending tunnel. Its walls are made of * quartz, and through it they can see thousands of tons of water flowing around them. *
They reach a dead end. They look up and see an opening. RUMBLING * of water gets louder towards them . *
Water cascades into the quartz tunnel, ROARING up behind them. * It overtakes them, sweeping them along, the tunnel fills up- and * a whirlpool begins- forcing them upward --they swirl all the way *
up --
		159  EXT AKATOR DUSK  -- and EXPLODING out the top of the tunnel, some distance away form the temple itself. They land on the side of the cliffs that surround Akator, a short distance from the top.  Behind them, the Great Stone Temple is crumbling, collapsing into its center area, debris of all kinds whirling as if in a gigantic centrifuge. 
		160  EXT PLATEAU-ABOVEAKATOR DUSK  The four survivors scramble up a small incline as behind them, the Great Stone Temple completely flattens with a gigantic BOOM, devastating the entire plateau as its great weight drops all at once, filling the space created by the giant sinkhole. 
*
The four survivors duck for cover, behind the rocks. *
The huge cloud of whirling debris still spins around a glowing orb in the center, it’s the base of the temple, the spinning, shining, silvery walls that surrounded the temple room.
But now the orb itself turns sideways and vanishes, and as it does, the giant cloud of debris is sucked onto the tiny dot into * which the orb disappeared, leaving not a speck of dust behind as * evidence. When this last bit of support is yanked from the * landscape, the cliffs around it collapse and, with a sound like a bedsheet RIPPING in half --
-- the great reservoir on the hillside across from them CRACKS in half, sending its ocean of water cascading down over the ruins of the city, flowing over the rubble and filling up the space, like the Red Sea flowing back into place.
129. 10/17/07
Indy, Marion, Mutt, and Oxley collapsed on the hillside as the * churning waters settle, turning what was once the greatest city of all time into a peaceful mountain lake . *
Indy stands and looks out. * INDY *
Did you see that? * OXLEY *
Like a broom to their footprints...
It’s dusk now, and the first stars are coming out. Slowly, the sounds of the jungle return.
INDY Where did they go?
(looks up) Space? *
OXLEY Not into space. Into the space -- * -- between spaces.
Indy looks at his frail, scholarly old friend is wonder. *
MUTT (looking down at the ruins)
I don’t get it. The legend said it was * suppose to be a city of gold. *
INDY The Ugha word for gold translates as
“treasure.” But the treasure wasn’t * gold, it was knowledge. Knowledge was * their treasure. *
Marion walks up to Mutt and touches his face near the wide gash * that has re-opened down his right cheek. *
MARION Oh, honey, you’re going to have a nasty * scar.
MUTT * I know. *
Indy moves back and leans against a rock, everything hurts * everywhere. He motions for Marion to join him, she sits next to * him. They look at each other and embrace. *
It’s getting dark.
MUTT (cont’d) what, we’re just gonna sit here?
INDY Night falls quick in the jungle, kid.
You don’t want to climb down the mountain in the dark.
MUTT No, I can. Who’s coming with me?
He heads down the steps.
INDY Why don’t you stick around, Junior?

*
130A. 10/17/07
Dean Stanforth, the dean of Indy’s college, hurries down a * corridor in the college building. He’s dressed in his Sunday * best, seems terribly late for something. *
But he stops for a moment outside the door to an office. A * PAINTER is standing in front of a certain door, adding to the * stencilled name on its frosted glass panel. *
On the top line it says ”PROFESSOR HENRY JONES JR.” But on the * line just below it, the Painter is adding two words: *
ASSOCIATE DEAN *
The Painter is just finishing the last N. Stanforth hesitates, * smiling. The Painter looks over his shoulder, am I doing * something wrong? *

162 INT CHAPEL DAY --cut the same Bible, now held in the hands of a SERIOUS *
MINISTER, standing at the front of an impressive church. *
Indy, dressed in a suit and bow tie, stands before him, and * Marion’s next to him, looking radiant in a simple white suit. * Mutt’s just beside Indy, in a sharp suit and tie. *
MINISTER * Henry Jones, Jr. and Marion Ravenwood, in * so much as the two of you have agreed to * live together in Holy Matrimony, have * promised your love for each other by * these vows, the joining of your hands * and the giving of these rings, I now * declare you to be Husband and Wife. Whom * God hath joined together, let no one put * asunder. *
Stanforth sits in the first row, smiling happily, his WIFE beside * him. Harold Oxley is next to them, washed and brushed up and * looking fine.
OXLEY Ahh, “how much of human life is lost in
waiting.” Up front, the Serious Minister drones on. *
MINISTER * Congratulations, you may kiss your * bride. *
Marion hands her flowers to the Minister and impulsively hugs * and kisses Indy. *
The small crowd CLAPS and Oxley leaps to his feet, cheering. * The couple with Mutt head down to meet the crowd. *
OXLEY Well done, Henry!
At the sound of their shared name, Indy and Mutt both turn. They grin and speak at the same time.
INDY Thanks, Ox!
The Serious Minister wraps it up.
MUTT Thanks, Ox!

132. 10/17/07 Mutt moves to one of the pews and grabs his camera, gets ready to *
take a photo. *
The front doors of the church blow open. A breeze rushes in. A * familiar fedora blows right off its hook and rolls down the * center aisle, coming to rest at the toes of a pair of scuffed-up * motorcycle boots. *
Mutt picks up the hat, dusts it off, and looks at it. He hesitates for a moment, then raises it to his own head, maybe just to see if it fits, he’s got it halfway there but --
-- A HAND reaches in. Indy snatches the hat away from Mutt, gives him a look, and puts the battered old fedora back, the only place * it belongs, on his own head.
Indiana Jones holds his arm out for Marion, she takes it, and they walk out through the open doors that lead to anywhere.
The crowd follows, leaving Mutt standing alone. He takes his *
leather jacket and camera and heads out.
*
FADE OUT.
